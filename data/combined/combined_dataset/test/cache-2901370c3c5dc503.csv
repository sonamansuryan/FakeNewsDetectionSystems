"SEE ALSO: ORLANDO KNOWN WOLF Watched by FBI, Worked with DHS, Amid Crisis Actors, Drills & CI s21st Century Wire says The Orlando Shooting. Many things are just not right with this story, including the father of the alleged shooter Omar Mateen, an Afghan-American, Seddique Mateen, who is closely linked to some of the most powerful leaders and agencies in Washington DC.Below is a photo of Omar s father after a meeting at the US State Dept. in Washington DC where he met with officials , but oddly, no log of his visit is available in the public record. Image Credit: facebook.com/seddique.mateenThe alleged shooter s father played an absolute key role in setting up the entire hate crime narrative by inserting this quote into the MSM machine during the immediate aftermath of the sensationalized media event. Seddique Mateen said: We were in Downtown Miami, Bayside, people were playing music, and he saw two men kissing each other in front of his wife and kid and he got very angry. They were kissing each other and touching each other and he said, Look at that. In front of my son they are doing that. And they we were in the men s bathroom and men were kissing each other. For the media, and every other political leader in the US, this was now classified as a hate crime , and so case closed. In other words, a simple story line with real traction was now baked firmly into this event about a homophobic, ISIS-inspired, crazed lone gunman who went postal in a Orlando gay nightclub, and coincidentally, on the eve of an international Gay Pride celebration day.Pictured below is Seddique Mateen with California Republican Congressman Dana Rohrabacher. Rohrabacher (R-CA) was initially elected to Congress in 1988, with the fundraising help of friend Oliver North.Rohrabacher s decades-long involvement in all things Afghan eventually earned him the nickname Gunga Dana. Today he chairs the United States House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Europe, Eurasia and Emerging Threats.This morning President Obama called him a home-grown terrorist. In a series of phone interviews Monday morning, Donald Trump responded that there s something going on with the President s reaction to the Orlando shooting.I guess even a stopped clock is right twice a day. It s like calling Blackwater XE Orlando shooter Omar Mateen s father said his son was not motivated by Islamist radical ideology, but in a Facebook video posted early Monday he said, God himself will punish those involved in homosexuality. My own suspicion was first awakened on Monday morning when U.S. news outlets uniformly reported that the father s TV show aired on a U.S.-based Afghan satellite channel. That sort of circumlocution is typical when something is being hidden which the corporate media prefers we not ask questions about.The name of the nameless Afghan satellite channel, Payam Afghan, is said to be widely-known in Southwest Asia as a CIA-Pakistani ISI construct, as this picture from Flicker shows.The identification of shooter Omar Mateen also involved deception. He was said to work for a security company called G4S, which few have ever heard of. However, G4S is merely a re-branded Wackenhut Corporation, a name with a storied reputation for scandal in the U.S. and around the world.Rohrabacher has stated that he sees radical Islam as the source of a major terrorist threat to the U.S.Calls to his office today to request comment on whether he views CIA assets relocated in the U.S. as a terrorist threat have not been returned.SEE FULL REPORT: ORLANDO KNOWN WOLF Watched by FBI, Worked with DHS, Amid Crisis Actors, Drills & CI sHelp support us by becoming a 21WIRE Member at: 21WIRE.TV",0,fakenewsnet,,Father of Orlando Shooter is Long-time CIA Asset

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clinton has pulled ahead of Republican rival Donald Trump in the traditional battleground state of Florida, strengthening her position in the race for the White House, the Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project showed ahead of the pair’s first presidential debate on Monday night. If the election were held on Monday, Clinton would lead Trump in the Electoral College by 259 to 191, with an 88 percent chance of reaching the 270 needed to win, according to the project’s results. The project, based on a weekly online tracking poll of more than 15,000 Americans, estimates state-by-state results that will drive the voting in the Electoral College, the body that ultimately selects the president. The results marked the first upward swing in the project for Clinton in several weeks. The last release of the poll, on Sept. 16, gave her a 61 percent chance of winning by a margin of about 14 Electoral College votes. The big difference now is that Florida, with its 29 Electoral College votes, favors Clinton 49 percentage points to Trump’s 45 points, the results showed. Trump has also lost ground in New Mexico, where he trails 47 points to 38 points. Colorado and Nevada, which had leaned toward Trump, are now too close to call. Together, those states represent another 20 Electoral College votes. Clinton lost ground in Oregon and Wisconsin, which are also too close to call. They amount to 17 votes combined. As many as 100 million viewers have been estimated for Monday evening’s debate at Hofstra University in New York state’s Long Island, which will begin at 9 p.m. Whether that high interest translates into a higher turnout on Election Day on Nov. 8 remains to be seen. A higher turnout would likely benefit Clinton, while the opposite would benefit Trump, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling, whose latest estimate is for a moderate turnout. Trump’s easiest path to victory would depend on a surge in turnout among white Republicans and lower-than-expected turnout among minority Democrats, according to the project. In that scenario, several Clinton-leaning states could flip. Florida, for example, would be a tossup, while Michigan, Wisconsin and North Carolina would lean toward the Republican. The States of the Nation results came as Clinton’s standing in national opinion polls have seen a small bounce in recent days. A separate Reuters/Ipsos national tracking poll released on Friday, for example, had her ahead by four points, up from a near tie two weeks ago.",1,fakenewsnet,,Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation: Clinton leads in Florida

"UNITED NATIONS/YANGON (Reuters) - U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley on Thursday called on countries to suspend providing weapons to Myanmar over violence against Rohingya Muslims until the military puts sufficient accountability measures in place. It was the first time the United States called for punishment of military leaders behind the repression, but stopped short of threatening to reimpose U.S. sanctions which were suspended under the Obama administration. We cannot be afraid to call the actions of the Burmese authorities what they appear to be - a brutal, sustained campaign to cleanse the country of an ethnic minority, Haley told the U.N. Security Council, the first time Washington has echoed the U.N. s accusation that the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people in Rakhine State was ethnic cleansing. Myanmar rejects the accusations and has denounced rights abuses. The Burmese military must respect human rights and fundamental freedoms. Those who have been accused of committing abuses should be removed from command responsibilities immediately and prosecuted for wrongdoing, Haley said. And any country that is currently providing weapons to the Burmese military should suspend these activities until sufficient accountability measures are in place, Haley said. Myanmar national security adviser Thaung Tun said at the United Nations on Thursday there was no ethnic cleansing or genocide happening in Myanmar. He told the Security Council that Myanmar had invited U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres to visit. A U.N. official said Guterres would consider visiting Myanmar under the right conditions. China and Russia both expressed support for the Myanmar government. Myanmar said earlier this month it was negotiating with China and Russia, which have veto powers in the Security Council, to protect it from any possible action by the council. The Trump administration has mostly hewed to former President Barack Obama s approach of forging warmer relations with Myanmar, partly aimed at countering China s influence in the resource-rich Southeast Asian country. Meanwhile, international aid groups in Myanmar have urged the government to allow free access to Rakhine, where an army offensive has sent more than 500,000 people fleeing to Bangladesh, but hundreds of thousands remain cut off from food, shelter and medical care. Refugees are still leaving Myanmar, more than a month after Rohingya Muslim insurgents attacked security posts near the border, triggering fierce Myanmar military retaliation. Aid groups said on Thursday the total number of refugees in Bangladesh was now 502,000. The Myanmar government has stopped international aid groups and U.N. agencies from carrying out most of their work in the north of Rakhine state, citing insecurity since the Aug. 25 insurgent attacks. Aid groups said in a joint statement they were: increasingly concerned about severe restrictions on humanitarian access and impediments to the delivery of critically needed humanitarian assistance throughout Rakhine State. We urge the government and authorities of Myanmar to ensure that all people in need in Rakhine State have full, free and unimpeded access to life-saving humanitarian assistance. The government has put the Myanmar Red Cross in charge of aid to the state, with the help of the International Committee of the Red Cross. But the groups said they feared insufficient aid was getting through. Relations between the government and aid agencies had been difficult for months, with some officials accusing the groups of helping the insurgents. Aid groups dismissed the accusations, which they said had inflamed anger toward them among Buddhists in the communally divided state, and called for an end to misinformation and unfounded accusations . Rights groups have accused the army of trying to push Rohingya Muslims out of Myanmar, and of committing crimes against humanity. They have called for sanctions, in particular an arms embargo. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned on Thursday that the violence against Rohingya Muslims in the northern part of Rakhine could spread to central Rakhine, where 250,000 more people were at risk of displacement. Guterres told the U.N. Security Council during its first public meeting on Myanmar in eight years, that the violence had spiraled into the world s fastest developing refugee emergency, a humanitarian and human rights nightmare. A group of Republican and Democratic senators urged the Trump administration on Thursday to use the full weight of its influence to help resolve the Rohingya crisis in Myanmar and Bangladesh. A letter seen by Reuters and signed by four Republican and 17 Democratic members of the 100-seat Senate also calls on Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and U.S. Agency for International Development Administrator Mark Green to provide more humanitarian aid. The British Minister of State for Asia and the Pacific, Mark Field, described the situation as an unacceptable tragedy after visiting Myanmar and meeting leaders including Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, who has faced scathing criticism and calls for her Nobel prize to be withdrawn. Police in Bangladesh said they recovered the bodies of 14 refugees, including nine children, who drowned when their boat capsized off the coast in bad weather. A Reuters photographer said he saw several babies among the victims. The U.N. International Organization for Migration later put the toll at 15. Police officer Afrajul Hoque Tutu said three boats had capsized in heavy seas. Myanmar was getting ready to verify refugees who want to return, the government minister charged with putting into effect recommendations to solve problems in Rakhine said. Myanmar would conduct a national verification process at two points on its border with Bangladesh under terms agreed during a repatriation effort in 1993, state media quoted Win Myat Aye, the minister for social welfare, relief and resettlement, as saying. Myanmar authorities do not recognize Rohingya as an indigenous ethnic group, instead regarding them as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. The government hates us, said refugee Zafar Alam, 55, sheltering from rain near a refugee settlement in Bangladesh, referring to the Myanmar government. I don t think I d be safe there.

"WELLESLEY, Mass. (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton assailed the man who beat her to the White House, slamming as “unimaginable cruelty” President Donald Trump’s proposal to cut $3.6 trillion in government spending over the next decade in a speech on Friday. The defeated Democratic candidate did not name the Republican president in her remarks to the graduating class at her alma mater, Wellesley College. But she took several veiled swipes at the businessman-turned-politician, whose budget proposal earlier this week proposed sharp cuts in programs for healthcare and food assistance. “Look at the budget that was just proposed in Washington. It is an attack of unimaginable cruelty on the most vulnerable among us,” Clinton told a crowd at the all-women’s college, located in Boston’s suburbs. “It grossly underfunds public education, mental health and even efforts to combat the opioid epidemic.” White House officials have described the proposed budget as providing tax cuts that they say would stimulate economic growth and create more private-sector jobs. As with all presidential budget proposals, the proposal was more of a wishlist that is unlikely to be approved in its current form by Congress. Clinton, a former secretary of state, warned against an erosion of accepted standards of truth in U.S. public discourse, and also appeared to be attacking Trump on this issue. “You are graduating a time when there is a full-fledged assault on truth and reason. Just log on to social media for 10 seconds, it will hit you right in the face,” she said, citing hoax online reports that her campaign was tied to a Washington pizzeria that operated a child sex ring. “When people in power invent their own facts and attack those who question them, it can mark the beginning of the end of a free society,” Clinton said. “This is not hyperbole, it is what authoritarian regimes throughout history have done.” She also urged graduates of the liberal-leaning school, which is located in one of the most Democratic states in the country, not to retreat into their own partisan echo chambers, saying, “your learning, listening and serving should include people who don’t agree with you politically.” Clinton has had a long public career since graduating in 1969 from Wellesley. She was first lady during her husband Bill Clinton’s two terms in the White House and was later elected to the U.S. Senate representing New York state. She made an unsuccessful presidential run in 2008 before serving as the country’s top diplomat during President Barack Obama’s first term. Clinton, 69, has gradually returned to the public eye since her upset November defeat, saying that she will not run for office again but will serve as an activist citizen.",1,fakenewsnet,,Hillary Clinton attacks proposed Trump budget cuts as 'cruelty'

"(Reuters) - Former FBI Director James Comey will testify to the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday about Russian involvement in the 2016 presidential election. President Donald Trump’s abrupt firing of Comey on May 9 renewed attention to allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the election to benefit Trump. It also raised questions about the motivations behind Comey’s dismissal. The following describes what is publicly known and not known about U.S. investigations into meddling and possible collusion between Russia and members of the Trump campaign: How did the investigations begin? Former President Barack Obama ordered U.S. intelligence agencies to assess whether Russia tried to intervene in the election after a cyber attack on the Democratic National Committee in July 2016 and the publication of thousands of hacked personal emails from Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager in the month before the Nov. 8 election. Obama told intelligence officials to deliver a report on possible foreign interference before he left the White House in January 2017. What did the intelligence agencies find? The Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency concluded in a report declassified in January that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a campaign not just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system but to affect the outcome. The agencies said Putin and the Russian government had a “clear preference” for Trump to win the White House. Putin’s associates hacked information, paid social media “trolls” and backed efforts by Russian government agencies and state-funded media to sway public opinion, the agencies said. The report stopped short of assessing whether Russia succeeded in swaying the election result. Putin and other Russian officials have repeatedly denied interfering in the U.S. election. How many U.S. probes are there into Russia’s election meddling? Comey told the House Intelligence Committee on March 20 that the FBI was investigating Moscow’s role in the election, including possible collusion with Trump’s campaign. The Justice Department announced on May 17 that it has appointed Robert Mueller, a former FBI director, as special counsel to lead an independent Russia probe. Mueller would, if the evidence merits, work in tandem with the FBI to handle any related criminal prosecutions. In addition there are multiple committees in the Senate and House of Representatives investigating various aspects of Russian election meddling. What has Trump said about Russia’s role in the election? Trump has not taken a clear public position. “I will tell you this, Russia: if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,” Trump said at a July 2016 news conference, in reference to an FBI probe into Clinton’s use of a private email system when she was secretary of state and emails that had possibly been deleted. Trump subsequently dismissed reports, including from U.S. intelligence officials, that Russia had attempted to intervene in the election on his behalf. The first time Trump said he accepted the findings of the intelligence agencies was at a Jan. 11 news conference ahead of his inauguration. “As far as hacking, I think it was Russia,” Trump said, although he added: “It could have been others also.” Trump said in May that China may have hacked the emails of Democratic officials to meddle with the election, offering no evidence and countering the view of intelligence officials. Trump has made clear on multiple occasions he believes the Russia investigations have run their course and should be closed. “The Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax, when will this taxpayer funded charade end?” he wrote on Twitter on May 8. On May 30, Trump wrote on Twitter: “Russian officials must be laughing at the U.S. & how a lame excuse for why the Dems lost the election has taken over the Fake News.” Did the FBI probe continue after Comey’s dismissal? There is no evidence that the FBI ended or paused its investigation after Comey’s departure. FBI acting Director Andrew McCabe, who is leading the agency, promised the Senate Intelligence Committee that Comey’s firing would not affect the investigation and that he will notify the committee of any attempt to delay or derail it. Trump on June 6 tapped former U.S. Justice Department official Christopher Wray, who represented New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in the so-called Bridgegate scandal, to be the next FBI director. Wray will need Senate confirmation. Why was Comey fired? The White House cited a May 9 letter to Trump from Attorney General Sessions that attached a memo from Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, on “Restoring Confidence in the FBI” that recommended Comey’s dismissal. Rosenstein’s memo said Comey erred in July 2016 by announcing the FBI had been examining Clinton’s use of a private email server and that the case should be closed without prosecution. Rosenstein’s view was that Comey’s decision to make a public statement broke with longstanding FBI precedent and should have been handled by the then-U.S. attorney general, Loretta Lynch. Trump called Comey a “showboat” and “grandstander” in an interview with NBC News on May 11, saying that he would have fired Comey regardless of Rosenstein’s recommendation. In an unorthodox move, Great America Alliance, an offshoot of a pro-Trump super PAC devoted to promoting the White House agenda, developed a television ad called “Showboat” to air as Comey testifies. The ad claims Comey was “consumed with election meddling” at the expense of fighting terrorism. Was Comey’s firing related to the FBI’s Russia probe? Whether Comey believes his firing was linked to the FBI’s Russia probe will likely be a main focus when he testifies on Thursday. Trump asked Comey to end the agency’s investigation of Michael Flynn, his former national security adviser, and also to make some sort of public statement that he was not personally under investigation in order to clear “the cloud” hanging over his presidency, according to Comey’s prepared testimony. Comey found it “very concerning” that Trump would ask him to drop the agency’s probe of Flynn and declined to state publicly that Trump himself was not under investigation, in part because it would create a “duty to correct” if that changed, according to the testimony. “I need loyalty, I expect loyalty,” Trump told Comey at a January 27 dinner, according to the testimony. Less than a week before he was fired, Comey told a congressional panel that it made him “mildly nauseous” that he may have affected the outcome of the election by publicly re-opening, and then re-closing, the Clinton email probe days before the election. Has there been any fallout for Trump associates over contacts with Russia before, during or after the election campaign? Flynn was fired in February. The White House said he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about the contacts he had with Russia’s ambassador to the United States, Sergei Kislyak, before Trump took office. On May 9, federal prosecutors issued grand jury subpoenas seeking business records from people who worked with Flynn when he was a private citizen. On May 10, the Senate Intelligence Committee issued the first subpoena in its Russia investigation, demanding documents from Flynn. He provided the first batch on June 6. Sessions had to recuse himself from involvement in Russia-related probes at the Justice Department because he had not told Congress of his own contacts with Kislyak in 2016. Rosenstein is handling matters related to Russia and it is he who appointed Mueller as special counsel. Is Trump himself under investigation? In the short letter Trump sent to Comey dismissing him from the FBI, he thanked Comey for informing him on three separate occasions that he was not under investigation. Comey confirmed in his written testimony that he told Trump that he was not personally under investigation.",1,fakenewsnet,,Q&A: What we know about U.S. probes of Russian meddling in 2016 election
"BARCELONA/MADRID (Reuters) - A general strike called by pro-independence campaigners in Catalonia closed shops and severed transport links on Wednesday, as the region s deposed leader lost political momentum after failing to seal an electoral pact with another party. Protesters closed roads, causing huge tailbacks into Barcelona, while some public transport ran minimum services and some smaller stores remained shuttered. Reuters saw hundreds of strikers gathered in Barcelona s main Sant Jaume square to protest the imprisonment of politicians, chanting the name of ex-leader Carles Puigdemont and referring to him as our president . But he faces an uphill task to maintain influence after he missed a deadline of midnight on Tuesday to agree a pro-secessionist pact for a regional election with his former vice president Oriol Junqueras. The central government in Madrid called the election for Dec. 21 after last month assuming control of Catalonia following its parliament s unilateral independence declaration. Spain s Constitutional Court on Wednesday officially annulled the declaration, which it had suspended, a widely expected ruling. Catalonia s secessionist push has plunged Spain into its worst political crisis in four decades, leading to a business exodus and reopened old wounds from the civil war in the 1930s. Junqueras is in custody on charges of sedition, rebellion and misuse of public funds. But polls show his leftist ERC party will win three times as many seats next month in the regional assembly than the centre-right PDeCAT of Puigdemont, who is in self-imposed exile in Belgium and facing the same charges. If that forecast proves correct it represents a very uncomfortable position for Puigdemont, said Jose Miguel de Elias, of political consultancy Sigma Dos. If (the secessionists) get enough seats to form a government, he would be vice president, which ... would not suit him. In Catalonia there was a mixed reaction to the pro-independence strike, called by two civic groups, whose heads were imprisoned last month on sedition charges, and a labor union. People stood across dozens of major highways waving placards and chanting freedom for political prisoners , TV and video images showed, while minor scuffles were reported on social media as police attempted to move protesters. While many smaller stores left their shutters down due the strike, most larger shops and businesses appeared to be open as normal. Why should I strike, nobody is going to raise my salary... The politicians should work more and stop their silliness, Jose Luis, a Barcelona construction worker, told Reuters TV on his way to work. Protester Josep Cardona, a 55-year-old office worker, had not joined a previous strike, but this time with putting people in prison, it has all gone too far, he said. Strike supporter Nuria Catalana, a 64-year-old nurse, said she had favored a pro-secessionist electoral pact, but understood the difficulties involved. We ll have to see if they really pay attention to whoever wins the election. We have to continue the struggle, she said. Puigdemont had ambitions to garner support for his independence campaign in the heartland of the European Union. But that hope has fallen flat, and in an interview published on Wednesday he renewed criticism of the bloc s executive. (EU Commission President Jean-Claude) Juncker welcomes mayors, governors ... but he doesn t want to meet me, Puigdemont told Belgian Daily De Standaard. I ve always been a convinced European ... But the people who are running the EU now are wrecking Europe. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who has been unwavering in his opposition to any form of independence for Catalonia, said he hoped next month s election would usher in a period of calm and business as usual for the region. I m hoping for massive participation ... and, after that, we ll return to normality, he said in the Madrid parliament building on Wednesday. An opinion poll released on Sunday by Barcelona-based newspaper La Vanguardia showed Junqueras ERC could garner 45 or 46 seats in the regional assembly and Puigdemont s PdeCat just 14 or 15. That would leave them needing to form a parliamentary alliance with anti-capitalist CUP to reach the 68-seat threshold for a majority. ERC and PDeCAT could still reach an agreement after the vote, but by standing together they could have held more seats, polls and projections from the 2015 election results showed.",1,fakenewsnet,,Catalan strike severs road links as secessionist leader regroups

"A new ad from a pro-Hillary Clinton super PAC hits Donald Trump for his dishonorable attacks on the family of Captain Humayun Khan, who died serving in the U.S. Army in Iraq.The ad from Priorities USA features Michelle DeFord, the mother of David Johnson, a National Guardsman who died while operating as a gunner on a Humvee in Iraq.Speaking about Trump s attacks on the Khan family in the ad, Deford says, When I saw Donald Trump attack another Gold Star mother, I felt such a sense of outrage. I would like to tell Donald Trump, she continues, what it feels like. The sense of emptiness that only losing a child can bring. Those people should be honored and treated with kindness for the rest of their life. Trump s attacks on the Khan family have been widely condemned by both Democrats and Republicans. Recent polls have shown that the vast majority of Americans over 60 percent believe that Trump s smears, over multiple days, were far over the line of acceptable political behavior.The Washington Post recently reported that Trump suffers in the election from the perception that he lacks basic human decency about what should and should not be said in the course of a campaign.Several Gold Star families, who have lost their sons and daughters in war zones, have condemned Trump for his behavior and demanded an apology (he has not given one).On the other side, many of Trump s most ardent supporters not only support the attack on the Khan family but have furthered multiple conspiracy theories and rumors about them, while some have even attacked their dead son and called him either a traitor or a phony.Republicans have always enjoyed strong support among the military, it remains to be seen if the nominee attacking a Purple Heart winner and his family will do anything to erode that going forward.Featured image via YouTube",0,fakenewsnet,, Gold Star Mom SHAMES Trump In Devastating Video You Need To See

With the help of our Department of Justice, towns are being threatened if they don t cave to the construction of mega Mosques:Over the past decade, the total number of mosques in the US has continued to grow at a tremendous rate. As part of this Survey, a count of all mosques in the US was conducted and 2,106 mosques were identified. A total of 1,209 mosques were counted in 2000, and 962 mosques were counted in 1994.Islam is set to surpass Christianity as the most popular religion in the world in no time flat:How Many Muslims In The World? Islam Set To Overtake Christianity As Most Popular Religion, While US Population Also Rapidly GrowingIslam is the fastest growing religion in the world and will overtake Christianity as the most popular before the end of this century, according to an analysis of religious surveys published Tuesday by the Pew Research Center.With 1.6 billion, Muslims made up 23 percent of the world s population, according to a 2010 Pew estimate. That figure was still some way short of the 2.2 billion Christians which comprised 31 percent of the population.However, by 2050 there could be near parity between the numbers of adherents of the two religions for the first time in history. The reasons for this rapid growth are thought to be the greater number of children Muslims have compared to other religious groups and the comparatively young age of Muslims.PROPOSED 34-ACRE MUSLIM CEMETERY:Jack Hawkins, a Farmersville landowner, said he was strongly opposed to the cemetery and the Muslim religion in general. If I had my way, I would outlaw it in America. And I would tear down every mosque that was in this country. That s the way I feel about it, Hawkins said. Resident said that one of their main concern was the way in which Muslims inter their dead (In shrouds with NO caskets in the ground). Pastor David Meeks, of the Bethlehem Baptist Church, was one of the most vocal opponents in 2015 opposition he said has only grown stronger. From what I hear, from my perspective, is that people are really more concerned than before, Meeks said. There have been terrible, drastic things happen in the world through radical Islamic terrorism, and any thought of that coming to our community just brings and harbors anxiousness, you know, that we re concerned with.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump’s chances of clinching the U.S. Republican presidential nomination shot to a record high on global betting websites on Wednesday and the billionaire businessman, long viewed as a political outsider, won his first endorsement from a member of Congress. Trump easily won the Nevada caucuses on Tuesday, giving him his third win in four early nominating contests and pressuring Republican rivals to come up with a way to stop a candidate who only last year was not seen as a serious contender for the Nov. 8 presidential election. The real estate magnate swept Nevada by a margin of 22 percentage points, winning 45.9 percent of the vote. It was the high point so far of an unorthodox campaign during which Trump has fought with Pope Francis, called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and promised to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border to prevent illegal immigration. Trump’s Nevada win is likely to further frustrate Republican establishment figures who, less than a month ago, were hoping his campaign as a political outsider was stalled after he lost the opening nominating contest in Iowa to Ted Cruz, a U.S. senator from Texas. In his victory speech in Nevada, the former reality TV show host courted his base of blue-collar workers. “I love the poorly educated,” he said, mentioning several demographic groups among whom he said he was winning. By Wednesday, that phrase was being widely discussed online, with some finding it funny and others arguing it was a welcome, nonjudgmental embrace of a constituency that other politicians might speak of only as a problem to be fixed. Trump’s nearest rivals, Cruz and Marco Rubio, a U.S. senator from Florida, have frequently attacked each other, clearing a path for Trump to the Republican nomination that includes primary elections in a slew of southern states on March 1, known as Super Tuesday. “These guys have to figure out how to turn their fire on Trump,” said Ford O’Connell, a Republican strategist in Washington. Absent that, he said: “Which one is going to get out of this field?” Rubio said Trump was only backed by a minority of Republicans. “The vast and overwhelming majority of Republicans do not want Trump to be the nominee,” he told NBC, citing the network’s recent opinion poll putting him 15 points ahead of Trump in a one-on-one match-up. “As long as there are four people running dividing up the non-Trump vote sooner, you’re going to get results like what you saw last night.” Rubio and Cruz have struggled to match the popularity of Trump, who is more ready than the two senators to deviate from the tenets of the Republican Party’s brand of conservatism, including free trade and supply-side economics. Betting venues in Britain, Ireland and New Zealand show the online wagering community coalescing around Trump, once considered an interloper, attracting long-shot odds of 200/1. Odds for Trump becoming the Republican candidate for November have tightened all the way to 1/2 in some cases. “Mr Trump has triumphed yet again, despite political analysts almost unanimously writing him off as a serious presidential contender,” said Graham Sharpe from William Hill (WMH.L), adding one customer stood to collect at least $100,000 if Trump was elected to the White House. On Wednesday, Chris Collins, a Republican congressman from Trump’s home state of New York, became the first national lawmaker to endorse Trump, saying in a statement “it’s time to say no to professional politicians and yes to someone who has created jobs and grown a business.” While more than 1,200 delegates are needed to secure the Republican presidential nomination, Trump has built a formidable head start over Rubio, who came in second in Nevada with 23.9 percent, and Cruz with 21.4 percent. Opinion polls show Trump ahead in most Super Tuesday states. The primary election next Tuesday in Cruz’s home state of Texas is looming as a make-or-break moment for him after Trump’s growing success among the senator’s core base of evangelicals and other conservative supporters. “Texans have a good ability to see through baloney, to see through a smokescreen, to see through rhetoric and to look to substance,” Cruz said at an event in Houston, the state’s largest city. “I believe that is exactly what Texans are going to do next Tuesday.” (Additional reporting by Alana Wise and Eric Walsh; Written by James Oliphant and Jonathan Allen; Editing by Alistair Bell) This article was funded in part by SAP.

"HODEIDAH, Yemen (Reuters) - One of the latest victims of the cholera epidemic that has killed more than 2,000 people in Yemen had yet to even take her first breath. Her mother Safaa Issa Kaheel, then nine months pregnant, was brought into a crowded clinic in the Western port city of Hodeidah by her husband, who had to borrow the travel fare from a neighbor. My stomach started hurting more and more, said Kaheel, 37, a hydrating drip hooked into her arm. Once there, she was referred by nurse Hayam al-Shamaa for an ultrasound scan which showed her baby had died of dehydration - one of 15 to perish in the womb due to cholera in September and October, according to doctors at the city s Thawra hospital. I felt like death, Kaheel said, her voice strained. Thank god I survived the (delivery), but my diarrhea hasn t stopped. The Red Cross has warned that cholera, a diarrheal disease that has been eradicated in most developed countries, could infect a million people in Yemen by the end of the year. Two and a half years of war have sapped Yemen of the money and medical facilities it needs to battle the contagion, to which aid agencies and medics say the poor, the starving, the pregnant and the young are most vulnerable. The cholera ward is full of children - some writhing in agony, others eerily still. The blanket over one boy too weak to move rises and falls with his shallow breathing. Save the Children said in August that children under 15 represent nearly half of new cases and a third of deaths, with malnourished children more than six times more likely to die of cholera than well-fed ones. Millions of Yemenis are struggling to find food and the baking desert plains around Hodeidah are hotspots both of hunger and sickness. Yemen s war pits the armed Houthi movement against the internationally recognized government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, which is backed by a Saudi-led coalition that has launched thousands of air strikes to restore him to power. At least 10,000 people have been killed in the conflict. The country s health sector has been badly battered while a struggle over the central bank has left public sector salaries for doctors and sanitation workers unpaid. Soumaya Beltifa, spokesperson for the Red Cross in Sanaa, warned that a lack of funds and health personnel were blunting efforts to eradicate the disease, making it unlikely Yemen would be healthy again soon. The cholera epidemic has become a norm, leading to complacency in dealing with the disease, not only by civilians but also from the various (aid) organizations, she warned.",1,fakenewsnet,,Cholera claims unborn children as epidemic spreads Yemen misery

"THE MAIN STREAM MEDIA CHOOSES to ignore the facts about many of the statements made by key Senators, Obama and Biden in the past regarding Supreme Court confirmations in an election year. The key players who re now crying racism and partisanship were once staunch defenders of NOT confirming a Supreme Court nominee in an election year. Please spread this very important information around so that ALL Americans can see what hypocrites these men are. It s all about politics and power The five highest-ranking Democrats in the nation once staunchly defended the Senate s constitutional role in the Supreme Court confirmation process. Or at least they did, until now.Now, President Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, Senate Democratic Conference Vice Chairman Chuck Schumer, and Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Patrick Leahy are suddenly ignoring the constitutional role that the Senate is mandated in the Supreme Court confirmation process.President Obama is demanding a rushed confirmation of his eventual nominee. He along with Vice President Biden, and Senators Reid, Schumer, and Leahy are not only ignoring the Constitution but also historic precedent that since at least 1880 stands firmly on the side to giving the American people a voice in choosing who the next Supreme Court justice will be when a vacancy arises in a Presidential election year.But let s look at what each of these men did and said when they were in the Senate faced with confirming Supreme Court nominees (not in an election year, where historic precedent favors delaying confirmation until the next officeholder, but in the middle of a President s term in office).President Obama:Then-Senator Obama actually voted against Justice Alito s confirmation to the Supreme Court, taking a leading role in an attempted filibuster against his nomination, something the White House now mysteriously says he regrets. Regret was hardly the word to describe his position at the time. He eloquently described his view of the significant role played by the Senate in the Supreme Court confirmation process: It would appear that President Obama is one of the some who believe that the president, having won the election, should have complete authority to appoint his nominee and that the Senate s role is merely a rubber stamp. Though his position has changed, I don t believe the words of the Constitution have.Vice President Joe Biden:When then-Senator Biden chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee, he nearly invented the filibuster of Supreme Court nominees. It was he who created the concept of Borking a nominee as he prevented President Reagan s pick of Judge Robert Bork from being confirmed to the bench. Then-Senator Biden proclaimed: The framers clearly intended the Senate to serve as a check on the president and guarantee the independence of the judiciary, Mr. Biden said in August 1987 in defense of his newfound opposition to Judge Bork. The Senate has an undisputed right to consider judicial philosophy. Under Mr. Biden s leadership, holding up nominations to the nation s appeals courts also became a routine exercise. In 1988, the Senate Judiciary Committee delayed 17 months before refusing to confirm law professor and scholar Bernard Siegan to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals because of his libertarian positions on economic issues. . . . By 1992, 64 judicial nominees were stuck in the senatorial muck waiting for the Judiciary Committee to give them a yea or nay.A once judicial obstructionist of legend is now mostly forgotten by today s mainstream media.In 2005, Senator Biden explained his philosophy at length: At its core, the filibuster is not about stopping a nominee or a bill, it s about compromise and moderation. The nuclear option extinguishes the power of independents and moderates in the Senate. That s it, they re done. Moderates are important if you need to get to 60 votes to satisfy cloture; they are much less so if you only need 50 votes. Let s set the historical record straight. Never has the Senate provided for a certainty that 51 votes could put someone on the bench or pass legislation. A year later, Senator Biden quipped, I think a filibuster makes sense when you have a prospect of actually succeeding. When Justice Alito s nomination came before his committee, he declared, If he really believes that reapportionment is a questionable decision . . . then clearly, clearly, you ll find a lot of people, including me, willing to do whatever they can to keep him off the court . . . . That would include a filibuster, if need be. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid:As Senate Majority Leader, Reid slashed much of the Senate s historic role in confirming judges by invoking the nuclear option removing the filibuster from the confirmation process of many judgeships, but notably not the Supreme Court.Of course Senator Reid has been the leader of political partisanship, flip-flopping on the judicial confirmation process more than anyone else in the Senate. After leading the filibuster against President Bush s nominee to a circuit court judgeship, Miguel Estrada, and vehemently opposing the nuclear option, he then invoked the nuclear option to remove the filibuster when his party took the Senate and the White House.But one thing Senator Reid has said stands out. Judicial nominations are so important that the Senate s constitutional role is at best, we move slowly in the confirmation process. And in regard to its constitutionally prescribed advice and consent on Supreme Court nominations, he chided, The Senate will enact its will. Senate Democrat Conference Vice Chairman Chuck SchumerSenator Schumer has been one of the most outspoken promoters of the Senate s power in the nomination process, taking that position to the extreme.In 2007, he declared that the Senate should not confirm a [Bush] Supreme Court nominee EXCEPT in extraordinary circumstances. He continued: We should reverse the presumption of confirmation. The Supreme Court is dangerously out of balance. We cannot afford to see Justice Stevens replaced by another Roberts; or Justice Ginsburg by another Alito. Of course, he too quickly abandoned this position this week.Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Patrick Leahy:Senator Leahy is probably the clearest supporter of the historic precedent against Supreme Court justices being confirmed in an election year.December 2006: The Thurmond Rule, in memory of Strom Thurmond he put this in when the Republicans were in the minority, which said that in a presidential election year, after spring, no judges would go through except by the consent of both the Republican and Democratic [leaders].

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration proposed a rule on Friday aimed at attracting thousands of immigrant entrepreneurs to start companies in the United States. The rule, proposed by the Department of Homeland Security, would ease the ability of startup founders to build companies if they have significant funding from U.S. investors. The administration hopes the rule will be completed before President Barack Obama’s term ends on Jan. 20. The proposed rule is part of Obama’s commitment to “attracting the world’s best and brightest entrepreneurs to start the next great companies here,” Tom Kalil, a technology policy adviser at the White House, told reporters in a call. Kalil said immigrants have co-founded as many as one in four high-tech startups across the United States and more than half of all startups in Silicon Valley. Immigration has been a crucial issue in the 2016 presidential campaign ahead of the Nov. 8 election. Republican candidate Donald Trump has vowed to toughen immigration policies, while Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton has proposed creating an office of immigrant affairs to expand Obama’s efforts to help immigrants integrate better into the country. Under the rule, DHS would issue temporary permission for entrepreneurs to live in the United States if they have at least 15 percent ownership in startup companies formed in the country within the past three years. The companies must have investment of at least $345,000 from qualified U.S. investors. The administration expects about 3,000 immigrants would apply for the temporary permission, known as parole. Max Levchin, a co-founder of PayPal and other companies who was born in Ukraine, said the proposed rule is a “great, concrete step toward creating more jobs in America and more success stories.” Many entrepreneurs are educated at prestigious U.S. universities, but find themselves unable to stay in the country because they lose visa lotteries or can’t afford to sponsor themselves through an existing investor visa program. “We lose and will continue to lose talented, skilled, well educated scientists, engineers and entrepreneurs because they are simply not allowed to stay and work after we educated them to very high standards,” Levchin said. “It makes very little sense.”",1,fakenewsnet,,White House proposes rule to welcome immigrant entrepreneurs

"A disturbing sex scandal that rocked the Oakland, California police department has now expanded to several other East Bay Area districts.The allegations now involve nearly two dozen CA police officers, all accused of having sex with a teenager they nicknamed Juve, short for Juvenile.The scandal broke after text messages between the girl and Oakland county police officers were discovered by a federal monitor who was assigned to oversee the police department.During an interview with KPIX, the teen, who is now an adult, told reporters that at least two dozen officers slept with her.In return for sex with the police she says she was given confidential police information, including tips on scheduled anti-prostitution stings. She also says she received extra police protection when she was working the streets as a prostitute.An unidentified officer in his 80s is reported to have paid $250 to have sex with the girl.On June 9, Oakland Police Chief Sean Whent was relieved of his position, due to his own involvement in the scandal. While it was Whent s job to investigate the allegations, according to the young woman at the center of the investigation, he was one of the officers involved in it.San Francisco CBS affiliate reports that:Whent s removal from the top brass position comes amid an internal affairs investigation and a criminal investigation focused on several Oakland police officers who allegedly had sex with an underage girl.This story is disturbing on so many levels. As law enforcement officers these cops were responsible to protect this teen from sex traffickers.

"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela s sacked former chief prosecutor on Thursday asked the International Criminal Court to capture and try President Nicolas Maduro and other top officials for crimes against humanity over murders by police and military officers. Luisa Ortega, who broke with Maduro this year after working closely with the ruling Socialist Party for a decade, was fired in August after she opposed Maduro s plan to create an all-powerful legislature called the Constituent Assembly. She fled the country and has traveled the world denouncing alleged acts of corruption and violations of human rights. Ortega said her complaint, filed on Wednesday with the Hague-based tribunal, was prompted by some 8,290 deaths between 2015 and 2017 at the hands of officials who received instructions the government. (They happened) under the orders of the executive branch, as part of a social cleansing plan carried out by the government, she told reporters in the Hague. The government did not immediately respond to a request for a comment. The accusation refers to incidents of torture, extrajudicial killings and arbitrary arrest. Some of them took place during a crackdown on anti-government protests that rocked the country between April and July and left at least 125 people dead, some of them at the hands of military and police officers. The Maduro government accused Ortega of turning a blind eye to violence by opposition supporters, and has also leveled a raft of corruption charges at her. Ortega s request also makes reference to killings that took place during police raids known as Operations to Free the People, which have been heavily criticized by human rights groups since they began in 2015. Nicolas Maduro and his government must pay for this, she said. The complaint also accuses top officials such as Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino and intelligence chief Gustavo Gonzalez of involvement in the alleged abuses. Ortega s critics say she was closely allied with Maduro s efforts to crack down on dissent and, before her break with him, had helped jail opposition leaders on trumped-up charges. Maduro s government insists it respects human rights and says opposition demonstrations were Washington-backed efforts to violently overthrow him. Despite their bitter differences, Venezuela s government and opposition agreed on Wednesday to a new round of foreign-mediated talks in the Dominican Republic on Dec. 1.",1,fakenewsnet,,Venezuela's ex-prosecutor wants Maduro tried at the Hague

"Remember when Donald Trump claimed that Ford was moving jobs and production to Mexico? Well, we all knew he was lying then, but he s admitting it now by bragging about it.In September, Trump accused the American car manufacturer of intending to take jobs from workers in Kentucky and take them to Mexico.But that was blatantly false because of a labor contract between the company and the worker s union, and Ford was quick to call out Trump for lying.As it turns out, Ford is only moving production of certain vehicles to Mexico but keeping the same workforce in the United States busy producing other vehicles. And Kentucky was never going to lose production of the Lincoln MKC SUV, even if Trump had never entered the presidential race at all.Well, Trump decided to take credit for something that wasn t going to happen anyway by bragging on Twitter that he single-handedly stopped Ford from moving the Kentucky plant to Mexico.Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky no Mexico Donald J.

That credit should go to the labor union responsible for negotiating the contract that prevented Ford from moving the plant out of Kentucky in the first place.But by bragging about it anyway, Trump basically just admitted that he lied when he claimed Ford was moving the factory to Mexico.

"BEIJING (Reuters) - Springer Nature, which publishes science magazines Nature and Scientific American, said on Wednesday it had pulled access to a small number of articles in China to comply with regulations, adding that it viewed the move as regrettable but necessary. The decision comes after Britain s Cambridge University Press (CUP) said in August it had removed from its website in China about 300 papers and book reviews published in the China Quarterly journal, after a request from the Chinese government. CUP, the publishing arm of elite Cambridge University, later reversed its decision and reposted the articles, following an outcry from academics, who attacked the decision as an affront to academic freedom. In a statement, Germany-based Springer Nature said that less than one percent of its content had been limited in mainland China. This action is deeply regrettable, but has been taken to prevent a much greater impact on our customers and authors, it said. This is not editorial censorship and does not affect the content we publish or make accessible elsewhere in the world. It is a local content access decision in China done to comply with specific local regulations, it added. The Financial Times said at least 1,000 Springer Nature articles had been blocked in China, containing sensitive key words like Taiwan, Tibet and Cultural Revolution. Under President Xi Jinping, Beijing has stepped up censorship, tightened controls on the internet and various aspects of civil society, and strengthened Communist Party authority over academia and other institutions. Beijing said in September that Chinese importers of foreign publications must verify the products were legal. China s State Council Information Office did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment sent after office hours. In not taking action we ran the very real risk of all of our content being blocked, Springer Nature said. We do not believe that it is in the interests of our authors, customers, or the wider scientific and academic community, or to the advancement of research, for us to be banned from distributing our content in China. Cambridge University Press had said it had blocked articles on topics including the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy protests, the 1960s Cultural Revolution and Tibet, in order to keep its other academic and educational materials available in the country.",1,fakenewsnet,,Springer Nature blocks access to certain articles in China

"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Venezuela s former chief prosecutor Luisa Ortega met Mexico s attorney general on Thursday, a Mexican official said, weeks after she fled her homeland accusing Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro of involvement in corruption. Ortega, who was removed from her position earlier this month, said a week ago she had evidence that Maduro was involved in graft with construction company Odebrecht. The 59-year-old Ortega has said she would give details of the corruption cases to authorities in the United States, Spain, Mexico, Brazil and Colombia. Mexican attorney general Raul Cervantes met Ortega for around 10 minutes in Mexico City, an official at the attorney general s office said. He gave no further details of the meeting and spoke on condition of anonymity. Late on Thursday, Ortega posted a picture on Twitter of herself with Cervantes in Mexico, saying the two had met to coordinate actions in the fight against corruption. Pictures posted on social media earlier on Thursday showed Ortega arriving at Mexico City airport. Ortega says she has been persecuted by opponents in an effort to hide details of high-level corruption and that she has proof of it. She was a key player in Venezuela s government before breaking with it in March. Ortega left Venezuela for Colombia and traveled to Brazil to meet prosecutors last week. Odebrecht admitted in a settlement with U.S. and Brazilian prosecutors to paying bribes across 12 countries to win contracts. According to a U.S. court ruling, Odebrecht paid about $788 million in bribes in countries including Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela between 2001 and 2016.

"If Rubio isn t smart enough to see that Trump s catapult to the top of the GOP contenders happened the moment he took a strong stand against politicians putting illegal aliens before Americans, then is he really smart enough to run our nation? And maybe even more importantly, if Rubio does recognize the majority of voters across the board want to elect a President who will stop the invasion of illegal aliens into our country, who is he planning to represent if he were to get the nomination?Sen. [score]Marco Rubio[/score] (R-FL) is doubling down on his support for in-state tuition for illegal aliens.On ABC, George Stephanopoulos asked Rubio about his work in the Florida statehouse in which he co-sponsored legislation to provide in-state tuition for undocumented immigrants. Stephanopolous asked Rubio directly: Do you stand behind that position now? Rubio said that he absolutely stands behind that legislation:RUBIO: It was a very narrowly drafted bill. You had to have a certain GPA, you had to live in the U.S. a long time, you had to graduate from a Florida high school. It was very narrowly tailored to high-performing students who found themselves in a situation where they were brought here by their parents when they were 5, didn t even speak another language except English and therefore couldn t attend college because they were being charged like they were from out of state. They still had to pay for college but they paid for what people paid when they lived in Florida. They had to be high school graduates of Florida.STEPHANOPOULOS: So you stand behind that?RUBIO: Yes, of a narrowly tailored bill like that, absolutely.In theory, this legislation means that an American student wishing to attend a Florida state university, who is from the neighboring state of Georgia, would have to pay higher tuition costs than an illegal immigrant from El Salvador, who has been living unlawfully in Florida and attending American public schools for the past thirteen years on the taxpayer dime. Illegal aliens are also eligible for generous child tax credits, a benefit protected in the Gang of Eight bill. Indeed, the taxes requirement in the Gang of Eight bill would have meant illegal aliens could receive tax payments in the form of free cash from the IRS, since poor illegal aliens have no tax liability.Rubio s plan to discount college tuition for illegal aliens will serve as a further magnet to new illegal immigration, and will also increase competition for college slots and post-college jobs for American youth who are already struggling. Moreover, due to affirmative action policies, these illegal aliens will not have their tuition discounted but their applications given preferential treatment as well.By contrast, front-runner Donald Trump told NBC s Chuck Todd that same day that he opposes Rubio s legislation to give illegal aliens taxpayer-funded tuition discounts.TODD: Senator Rubio sponsored a bill back in Florida (back when he was in the State House) to give in-state tuition for undocumented immigrants. There s a lot of states that allow in-state tuition for the children of undocumented immigrants. I ve not heard your position on that.TRUMP: I m opposed to it.TODD: Totally opposed?TRUMP: They re here. They re not here legally. I m opposed to itTODD: Even kids born to illegal immigrants?It is perhaps interesting to note that Chuck Todd seems a bit confused about U.S. immigration policy illegal alien tuition discounts are for foreign-born youth who are themselves illegal immigrants. Under current policy, the US-born children are automatic birthright citizens, meaning no legislation is required to make them eligible for all the benefits enjoyed by Americans. Indeed, illegal immigrants primarily access welfare programs through their U.S.-born children. As a September 2015 report from the Center for Immigration Studies noted, analysis shows that legal immigrant households make extensive use of most welfare programs, while illegal immigrant households primarily benefit from food programs and Medicaid through their U.S.-born children. Regardless, Trump made clear in the interview he would ensure that neither illegal alien youth (DREAMers) or birthright citizenship children, would be eligible for such benefits. Trump made clear he would move to eliminate birthright citizenship so that the US-born children of illegal aliens would no longer made automatic citizens. Again, by contrast, Rubio supports birthright citizenship a position which is supported by only 20% of Republicans according to the most recent Rasmussen Reports immigration survey issued on December 27, 2015.Rubio s Sunday endorsement of discount college tuition for the foreign-born illegal alien youth is in keeping with his longstanding support for DREAM amnesty proposals, which have been a passion of Gang of Eight co-member [score]Dick Durbin[/score].While Rubio briefly distanced himself of his support for DREAMer amnesty in 2010 in order to get elected to the U.S. Senate and indeed attacked attacked his opponent [score]Charlie Crist[/score] specifically for his support of the DREAM Act upon arriving in the U.S. Senate, Rubio quickly used his new position of power to begin working on a plan to legalize so-called DREAMers. In 2012, Rubio wrote: They re not in compliance with immigration law, and, thus, not American citizens. But they are culturally as American as anyone else s children Rubio s statement might be news to Laura Wilkerson whose 18-year-old son, Joshua, was gruesomely murdered by his DREAMer classmate. In her Congressional testimony last summer, Wilkerson told lawmakers how her son was, beaten, strangled, tortured until he died. He was tied up, thrown in a field, and set on fire [During his trial], we had to hear this kid on the stand muttering about, In my country In my country never to finish that sentence. We listened to him tell us repeatedly that his killing skills took over . Wilkerson told lawmakers, You cannot you cannot stand by and ignore our families our American families. You re elected by Americans, not any other country. You should be for Americans. Yet Rubio remains so committed to amnesty for illegal immigrants who allegedly entered as minors that he has said he will not immediately revoke President Obama s lawless 2012 executive amnesty for DREAMers. In a Spanish-language interview with Jorge Ramos, Rubio said: Well, DACA is going to have to end at some point. I wouldn t undo it immediately. The reason is that there are already people who have that permission, who are working, who are studying, and I don t think it would be fair to cancel it suddenly. But I do think it is going to have to end. And, God willing, it s going to end because immigration reform is going to pass. Rejected-Majority Leader [score]Eric Cantor[/score] similarly supported Rubio s efforts to grant amnesty to illegal immigrants. Cantor declared, One of the great founding principles of our country was that children would not be punished for the mistakes of their parents. This prompted Cantor s then-primary challenger Rep. [score]Dave Brat[/score] (R-VA) to describe Cantor s declaration as one of the most radical pro-amnesty statements ever delivered by a sitting representative. Brat wrote, In what was billed as a new agenda for the Republican Party, Cantor declared that citizenship for illegals was required by the great founding principles of our country. With this remark, Cantor declared his support not only for amnesty now, but amnesty forever. Ken Palinkas, the former head of the nation s immigration caseworkers Citizenship and Immigration Services has similarly explained how the DREAM Act would represents a promise of perpetual amnesty :If it is improper to apply immigration law to one specific group of illegal aliens, then why should we expect future illegal aliens in this group to be treated any differently?Indeed, government reports have documented how the 2014 illegal alien minor surge on our southern border was caused, in large part, by the promise of amnesty for alien youth.As Senator [score]Jeff Session[/score] has written, It cannot be the policy of the United States that any of the 2 billion people in the world who have yet turn to turn 18 have a right to illegally enter the United States and claim residency. Polling data suggests that in the event Rubio s position on this controversial DREAMer amnesty begins to receive large-scale media coverage something that has not happened yet it could pose problems for him in New Hamspshire, where he is currently in second place. As The Hill reported in 2014, More people in New England oppose illegal immigration compared to the rest of the country Nearly 80 percent of people in that region said illegal immigrants threaten U.S. beliefs and customs, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll.New Hampshire also voted for Pat Buchanan in 1996 who, like Trump, is opposed to both the cheaper foreign labor and cheap foreign imports Senator Rubio has sought to import.Via: Breitbart News",0,fakenewsnet,,RUBIO DOUBLES DOWN ON Putting Illegal Aliens Before Americans

"NAIROBI/ABIDJAN (Reuters) - U.S. special forces soldiers were with their counterparts from Niger on Wednesday in the West African nation s volatile southwest, a growing hot-bed of jihadist violence, when the report came in of a raid nearby. The assailants were believed to be led by Dondou Chefou, a lieutenant in a new group operating along the Mali-Niger border and called Islamic State in the Greater Sahara. A decision was soon taken to pursue them. The mixed force was ambushed by fighters on dozens of vehicles and motorcycles. Under heavy fire, U.S. troops called in French fighter jets for air support, but the firefight was at such close quarters that the planes could not engage and were instead left circling overhead as a deterrant. The version of events, as told by two Nigerien and two Western sources briefed on the incident, shines a light on Washington s increasingly aggressive Special Forces-led counter-terrorism strategy in Africa and its risk of casualties. Four U.S. soldiers died in the firefight, killed in a country where most Americans were unaware that their army is deployed but where Washington has steadily grown its presence. One soldier s body was only recovered two days later. At least four Nigeriens were also killed and, according to one Niger security source, militants seized four vehicles in the ambush. French helicopters, scrambled after the U.S. call for help, evacuated several soldiers wounded in the clash. A diplomat with knowledge of the incident said French officials were frustrated by the U.S. troops actions, saying they had acted on only limited intelligence and without contingency plans in place. After initially offering only scant details of what happened in the Nigerien desert on Wednesday, the U.S. military s Africa Command said on Friday the soldiers were in the area to establish relations with local leaders. It was not meant to be an engagement with the enemy, Africom spokesman Colonel Mark Cheadle told reporters. The threats at the time were deemed to be unlikely, so there was no overhead armed air cover during the engagement. U.S. forces do not have a direct combat mission in Niger, but their assistance to its army does include intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance in their efforts to target violent extremist organizations. U.S. military deployments are on the rise in Africa. In May, a U.S. Navy Seal killed in a raid on an al Shabaab militant compound in Somalia became the first U.S. combat death in Africa since the 1993 Black Hawk Down disaster in Mogadishu. In Niger, Washington has deployed around 800 soldiers, runs a drone base in the capital Niamey, and is building a second in Agadez at a cost of around $100 million. U.S. Special Forces help local troops develop counter-terrorism skills to tackle threats from al Qaeda-linked groups, Nigeria s Boko Haram and Islamists who have pledged allegiance to Islamic State. It s a pretty broad mission with the government of Niger in order to increase their capability to stand alone and to prosecute violent extremists, the U.S. military s Joint Staff Director, Lieutenant General Kenneth McKenzie, said on Thursday. Washington has long seen the Sahel as a security threat but involvement increased in the wake of a 2012 occupation of northern Mali by Islamist militants. France led an offensive against the Islamists a year later, and the U.S. government now provides logistical and intelligence support to a 4,000-troop French counter-terrorism operation in the region. The U.S. military organizes an annual, high-profile U.S. drill as well as longer-term, more discreet training of regional forces. But experts say U.S. involvement in the fight does not stop there. It is likely that there are other operations going on aside from just the training operations, said Andrew Lebovich, a visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. In missions run out of a base in the northern Niger town of Arlit and others like the one that led to the ambush of U.S. troops, sources say they have helped local troops and intelligence agents make several arrests. It is discreet but they are there, a Nigerien security source told Reuters. Analysts are awaiting the political fallout of Wednesday s ambush with some speculating it may spark a reversal of the U.S. stance on a new regional force - known as the G5 Sahel - which France is pushing but which Washington is cool on. Others however like Ahmedou Ould Abdallah, a former top United Nations official in West Africa and Somalia, recall with concern the American pullout following the Black Hawk Down incident. Eighteen U.S. soldiers were killed when Somali militia shot down two helicopters in Mogadishu. In Somalia, they over-reacted and withdrew their troops ... My worry is that after this attack they will also over-react. Trump might just say Why should we die for this?

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States in July 2019 will end a special status given to about 59,000 Haitian immigrants that protects them from deportation after a devastating 2010 earthquake, senior Trump administration officials said on Monday. The decision by acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke gives Haitians 18 months to return to their impoverished Caribbean country or legalize their status in the United States. Former President Barack Obama’s administration granted Haitian nationals in the United States so-called Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, for 18 months after a 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck near Haiti’s capital, Port-au-Prince, in January 2010, killing more than 300,000 people. The Obama administration extended the status several times after the initial designation. Duke decided to terminate the special status after a U.S. review of the conditions in Haiti found the country had made considerable progress, a senior official with President Donald Trump’s administration told a briefing. “It was assessed overall that the extraordinary but temporary conditions that served as the basis of Haiti’s most recent designation has sufficiently improved such that they no longer prevent nationals of Haiti from returning safely,” the official said. In May, then-Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly extended the status for Haitians for six months through January 2018. At the time, Kelly told reporters that TPS “is not meant to be an open-ended law but a temporary law.” The decision to end TPS for Haitians is part of Trump’s broader efforts to tighten restrictions on immigration, and comes despite calls from even some fellow Republicans to continue the relief. Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida published an opinion piece in the Miami Herald on Friday urging the administration to renew Haiti’s TPS designation for another 18 months, citing ongoing natural disasters, health epidemics and security issues since the 2010 quake. Duke in September ended protected status for citizens of Sudan as of 2018, but extended it for citizens of South Sudan through mid-2019. This month, Duke decided to end the status for Nicaraguan immigrants, but extended the program for Honduran immigrants until July 2018.. Thousands of Nicaraguans and Hondurans received the special status in 1999 after Hurricane Mitch devastated Central America. The Washington Post reported that Kelly pressured Duke to end the program for Hondurans, but Duke denied the reports.",1,fakenewsnet,,U.S. to end protected status for Haitians in July 2019

"DHAKA (Reuters) - Pope Francis celebrated a huge outdoor Mass on Friday to ordain new priests from Bangladesh on his first full day in the country where he is due to meet Muslim Rohingya refugees from Myanmar later in the day. More than 100,000 people attended the Mass in Dhaka s Suhrawardy Udyan Park, site of a memorial and museum of Bangladesh s independence from Pakistan in 1971, where Francis arrived in an open popemobile. Catholics make up less than one percent of the population of 169 million people in majority-Muslim Bangladesh. I know that many of you came from afar, for a trip for more than two days, the pope told the crowd in his homily. Thank you for your generosity. This indicates the love you have for the Church. At an inter-religious gathering later on Friday, the pope was due to meet 18 Rohingya refugees who have fled to Bangladesh from Myanmar where authorities have been accused of ethnic cleansing by the United States and United Nations. The government denies wrongdoing. In calls for peace in Myanmar, he did not use the word Rohingya to describe the refugees, which is contested by the Yangon government and military. The refugees were brought to the Bangladeshi capital from Cox s Bazar, to where 625,000 Rohingya from Myanmar s Rakhine state have fled. The exodus followed a Myanmar military crackdown in response to Rohingya militant attacks on an army base and police posts on Aug. 25. Scores of Rohingya villages were burnt to the ground, and refugees arriving in Bangladesh told of killings and rapes. On Thursday night, the pope called for decisive measures to resolve the political reasons that caused the refugee crisis and urged countries to help the Dhaka government deal with it.",1,fakenewsnet,,Pope ordains priests in Bangladesh ahead of meeting with Rohingya

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan is expected to cruise to re-election in his Wisconsin congressional district on Nov. 8, the day before his real political problems are likely to start. That is when Ryan will know the shape of the new House of Representatives. If, as some analysts foresee, it becomes even more conservative than it is now, Ryan’s difficulties in managing the lower chamber of Congress could worsen. For the highest-ranking elected U.S. Republican, that could spell trouble as the former vice presidential nominee looks ahead to a possible presidential run in 2020. Some staunch House conservatives, questioning Ryan’s commitment to them and their agenda, are looking less kindly on the idea of re-electing him as speaker early next year. But his real test, assuming he retains the speaker’s gavel, would be getting legislative results with a more conservative House. Compounding that could be the U.S. Senate switching to Democratic from Republican control and possibly a Democratic president, Hillary Clinton, if she beats Republican Donald Trump in the November election. “Next year, almost no matter what, is going to be a very tough one for Paul Ryan,” said political scientist Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute think tank. The 2016 election results could cast a shadow over Ryan’s presidential ambitions in 2020 and 2024, assuming he harbors them. “It may well be that he decides it’s just not worth it, partly given what he sees within his own party,” Ornstein said. Ryan’s aides were reluctant on Monday to discuss the possible challenges of the next Congress. “The focus over the next 57 days is defending and strengthening our House majority. We are in a good position,” said Ryan’s political spokesman, Zack Roday. Republicans hold 246 of the 435 House seats, their biggest majority in decades. But analysts expect the party will lose seats in November, especially if Trump hurts fellow Republicans. House members serve two-year terms and most are easily re-elected. The political prediction newsletter “Sabato’s Crystal Ball” has tagged only 16 races as too close to call. Ten of those are currently held by moderates or pragmatists who have been fairly reliable supporters of legislation backed by Republican leaders including Ryan. Five of the 10 are retiring from the House. If Trump’s performance damages candidates down the ticket, moderates may bear the brunt. The result could be a smaller House Republican majority more dominated by politically secure conservatives of the sort who have in recent years defied Ryan on some legislation. “A shrinking GOP conference is no doubt going to be more conservative in the new Congress, raising the challenge for Speaker Ryan to form majorities with a slimmer and more conservative rank and file,” said Sarah Binder, professor of political science at George Washington University. If a number of moderates lose their seats, while most conservatives hold theirs, “then the House Freedom Caucus becomes more powerful,” said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of “Sabato’s Crystal Ball.” The Freedom Caucus is the House’s most conservative bloc, with about 40 members. It helped eject Ryan’s predecessor, John Boehner, a year ago, leading to Ryan’s election as speaker. The Freedom Caucus initially welcomed Ryan, a budget and fiscal policy specialist seen as more willing to listen to their agenda. But some Freedom Caucus members are unhappy with him since one of their members, Representative Tim Huelskamp of Kansas, lost a primary election last month. Ryan could have done more to help Huelskamp, some critics said. “There was huge disappointment in that,” said Representative John Fleming, a Freedom Caucus member from Louisiana who is running for the U.S. Senate in November. The Huelskamp fallout has driven speculation that some conservatives who previously backed Ryan will oppose him when the House elects a new speaker in January, although none of them has said so publicly. “I don’t think most members feel yet that Ryan is undeserving of more time (as speaker), but frustration with the leadership is certainly growing,” said Dan Holler of Heritage Action, the political wing of the Heritage Foundation conservative think tank.",1,fakenewsnet,,Paul Ryan's challenges will not start until after Nov. 8 election
"Scott Walker emerged from the ashes of his failed Presidential campaign this week when the primaries came to Wisonsin. But MSBNC host Chris Hayes gave him a further headache, by managing to destroy Walker s biggest lie, in just 16 brutal seconds.Walker is trying to pass tough voter ID laws which are likely to effectively disenfranchise the members of the community least likely to vote Republican, all in the name of preventing a voter fraud problem which doesn t actually exist. Walker tried the argument on MSNBC host Chris Hayes this week, and got destroyed. Alright, let s look at the facts, Hayes said. There s the fact that despite dire warnings of voter fraud, a Wisconsin federal district judge ruled that the law s defenders and I m quoting could not point to a single instance of known voter impersonation occurring in Wisconsin at any time in the recent past. The ruling took just 16 seconds to recite, but if the law passes regardless, more than 300,000 people (largely people of color, and people in poverty) will be unable to vote in the primaries. It is the continuation of the GOP s plans to effectively rig the vote, by disenfranchising people least likely to vote for them.Minority and poor communities are already hit by felony disenfranchisement as the Sentencing Project reports:Nationally, an estimated 5.85 million Americans are denied the right to vote because of laws that prohibit voting by people with felony convictions. Felony disenfranchisement is an obstacle to participation in democratic life which is exacerbated by racial disparities in the criminal justice system, resulting in 1 of every 13 African Americans unable to vote.Image via The Sentencing ProjectThe no-nonsense crushing shines a light on just how far the conservative media is failing its readers and viewers, by failing to do the most basic factcheck on these issues. Whether conservative or liberal, we deserve a media which holds politicians and lawmakers to account when they lie. Instead, we see the media playing partisan if our friends said it it s true, it our enemies said it, it s a lie.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price resigned under pressure from President Donald Trump on Friday in an uproar over Price’s use of costly private charter planes for government business. His abrupt departure was announced an hour after Trump told reporters he was disappointed in Price’s use of private aircraft and did not like the way it reflected on his administration. “Secretary of Health and Human Services Thomas Price offered his resignation earlier today and the president accepted,” the White House said in a statement. Trump named Don Wright to serve as acting secretary. Wright is currently the deputy assistant secretary for health and director of the office of disease prevention and health promotion. “I’m not happy. OK? I’m not happy,” Trump told reporters on the White House South Lawn. Candidates to succeed Price included Seema Verma, who is administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and who is close to Vice President Mike Pence, and Scott Gottlieb, a physician who serves as commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, according to industry analysts. Several sources saw Gottlieb as a clear front runner. They said he got along well with the White House and is viewed favorably there. Price’s resignation leaves Trump with a second Cabinet position to fill. He has yet to pick a secretary for homeland security after hiring former Secretary John Kelly as his White House chief of staff. It was the latest blow to the Trump White House, which has struggled to get major legislative achievements passed by Congress and has been embroiled in one controversy after another since Trump took office in January. Price, a former congressman, was instrumental in the Trump administration’s policies aimed at undercutting Obamacare, as well as working with governors across the country to slowly begin unraveling parts of the law. In a resignation letter, Price offered little in the way of contrition. He said he had been working to reform the U.S. healthcare system and reduce regulatory burdens, among other goals. “I have spent forty years both as a doctor and public servant putting people first. I regret that the recent events have created a distraction from these important objectives,” he said. Trump, currently trying to sell his tax cut plan and oversee the federal response to devastation wreaked by three hurricanes, saw the Price drama as an unnecessary distraction and behind the scenes was telling aides “what was he thinking?,” a source close to the president said. Price promised on Thursday to repay the nearly $52,000 cost of his seats on private charter flights. “The taxpayers won’t pay a dime for my seat on those planes,” Price said. But that was not enough to satisfy Trump. Trump told reporters that the “optics” of Price’s travel were not good, since, as president he was trying to renegotiate U.S. contracts to get a better deal for taxpayers. “Look, I think he’s a very fine person. I certainly don’t like the optics,” Trump said. Price had also been seen in the White House as having been ineffective in getting Congress to pass healthcare reform legislation, an effort that has fizzled on Capitol Hill. Price was one of a handful of senior officials in Trump’s administration put on the defensive over reports about their use of charter flights and government aircraft, sometimes for personal travel, when they could have flown commercial for less money. The White House issued an order late on Friday saying use of private planes required approval from White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and that the commercial air system was appropriate even for very senior officials with few exceptions. The Washington Post on Friday reported that Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin attended a Wimbledon tennis match, toured Westminster Abbey and took a cruise on the Thames this summer during a 10-day trip to discuss veterans’ health issues in Britain and Denmark. Shulkin, who traveled on a commercial airline, was accompanied on the trip by his wife, whose airfare was paid for by the government and who received a per diem for meals, the Post said, noting that the Department of Veterans Affairs said she was traveling on “approved invitational orders.” His six-person traveling party included an acting undersecretary of health and her husband as well as two aides. They were accompanied by a security detail of as many as six people, the Post said. Washington news media outlet Politico has reported that Price had taken at least two dozen private charter flights since May at a cost to U.S. taxpayers of more than $400,000. Politico also reported he took approved military flights to Africa and Europe costing $500,000. Senior U.S. government officials travel frequently, but are generally expected to keep costs down by taking commercial flights or the train when possible. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin have also been in the spotlight for their travel habits.",1,fakenewsnet,,"Under pressure from Trump, Price resigns as health secretary over private plane uproar"

"MADRID (Reuters) - A Spanish audit office has demanded the former leader of Catalonia and other politicians from the region pay 5 million euros ($5.96 million) for holding a consultative independence ballot in 2014, El Pais newspaper said on Tuesday. The report, which cited judicial sources, came a day before Catalonia is expected to approve plans to hold an Oct. 1 referendum on a split from Spain. The 2014 vote was non-binding, a symbolic ballot by pro-independence campaigners that was declared illegal by Spain s Constitutional Court. Catalonia, along with Britain s Scotland and Belgium s Flanders, has one of the most active independence movements in the European Union. El Pais said the former head of the Catalan government, Artur Mas and other regional leaders, were being told by the audit body in charge of overseeing the financing of political parties and the public sector to pay out of their own pocket for organizing the consultation vote. The money was due by Sept 25, it said. The audit office was not immediately available for comment. The current head of the Catalan government, Carles Puigdemont, said the move was the Spanish state spreading fear . Catalan lawmakers are due to vote on Wednesday on laws approving the referendum and the legal framework to set up an independent state. The laws are expected to be approved because pro-independence parties have a majority in the regional parliament. The populous, north-eastern region, with its capital Barcelona, has a strong national identity with its own language and traditions, although polls show support for self-rule waning as Spain s economy improves.",1,fakenewsnet,,Spanish auditors demand Catalan leaders pay for previous independence vote: El Pais

"James Pearce, an anti-gun adjunct professor at Southern State Community College in Ohio, made an outrageous, threatening Facebook post on June 13, 2016, that is reportedly under investigation by the proper authorities. By the way, the post still remains on his Facebook page. Apparently, making a threat about shooting people up on Facebook is not offensive to the paid censors as long as it s directed at the pro-gun crowd. A look at his Facebook page will prove that he is unapologetic after making the disgusting remarks and in fact, is calling it a joke. Funny we re not seeing the humor in these sick remarks: A bunch of us anti-gun types are going to have to arm ourselves, storm the NRA headquarters in Fairfax, VA, and make sure there are no survivors. Here is the actual post:The Highland County Press reported that Pearce s comments were sent to authorities and SSCC on June 15.Kris Cross, Director of Public Relations for SSCC, told Campus Reform that it is the college s policy not to comment on individual personnel matters, but did offer some general observations of potential relevance to the case. In general, the college would alert local authorities about any threats that were made known to the college, especially any threats made to students, faculty or staff, she explained. We have a good working relationship with the police jurisdictions covering each of our four campuses, and trust they would follow their protocols for reporting to other agencies. As I understand it, a report does not necessarily mean an investigation.

On June 17, SSCC Security and Emergency Response coordinator Gary Heaton noted that the information had been reported to the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security.

"NBC s Meet The Press tried as much as possible to be charitable to the Trump campaign during a segment in which they projected the electoral college map in a Trump vs. Clinton general election. But as host Chuck Todd discovered, when the math is against you, it just won t work.Todd opened the segment by repeating one of the tropes that Republican frontrunner and likely nominee Donald Trump has repeated for several months now: That he can somehow put states that have favored Democrats in play and flip them over to the Republican Party.Immediately it became clear that the Republicans face a huge uphill climb on election day. Factoring in states that have voted for either party on a consistent basis over the last four elections, the nightmare for Trump and the GOP is revealed, with 243 electoral votes for Clinton and only 180 for Trump. In a contest where 270 votes are needed, she s almost there without any so-called swing states being contested. Democrats have been able to bank on states like California, New York, Pennsylvania with a lot of delegates, in addition to very reliable states like Maryland, Massachusetts, Illinois, and New Jersey staying in solid territory for the party.By contrast, after Texas, it s hard to find solid Republican states with a lot electoral college heft to them. On a map the wide expanses of states like Wyoming, Nebraska and the Dakotas may seem impressive, but their sparse populations limit their impact on the electoral college.Todd then showed a scenario in which more recent swing states that have divided between the parties in recent elections have been counted. If Trump won Ohio, Virginia, and Florida under this scenario, he still comes up short and the reality is all of those states in the two most recent elections went to President Obama.Then the funniest or saddest point was made by Todd. For Trump to win if he somehow won those states (again, highly unlikely) he would need to find votes in Colorado or Nevada. Those states also went Democratic in the most recent election, but that isn t even the biggest obstacle to a Trump triumph. Todd pointed out that those are states with large Latino voting bases, also known as the community Trump has alienated and attacked characterizing them as rapists and murderers from the first day he was a presidential candidate.No election is set in stone, and it is more than half a year away to the general contest. But make no mistake, especially with Donald Trump as its nominee, the Republican Party is the one behind the eight ball, facing a series of odds that make them the most likely to lose the entire race.Featured image via screen capture",0,fakenewsnet,," WATCH: NBC Crunched The Numbers, And Trump Is Facing Election DISASTER"
"(Reuters) - A third of Republican voters who support Donald Trump could turn their backs on their party in November’s presidential election if he is denied the nomination in a contested convention, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll. The results are bad news for Trump’s rivals as well as party elites opposed to the real estate billionaire, suggesting that an alternative Republican nominee for the Nov. 8 presidential race would have a tougher road against the Democrats. “If it’s a close election, this is devastating news” for the Republicans, said Donald Green, an expert on election turnout at Columbia University. The Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted March 30 to April 8 asked Trump’s Republican supporters two questions: if Trump wins the most delegates in the primaries but loses the nomination, what would they do on Election Day, and how would it impact their relationship with the Republican Party? Sixty-six percent said they would vote for the candidate who eventually wins the nomination, while the remaining third were split between a number of alternatives such as not voting, supporting a third-party candidate, and switching parties and voting for the Democratic nominee. Meanwhile, 58 percent said they would remain with the Republican Party. Another 16 percent said they would leave it, and 26 percent said they did not know what they would do with their registration. The online poll of 468 Republican Trump supporters has a credibility interval of 5.3 percentage points. (Click here for the poll results: tmsnrt.rs/25PRLZe ) Trump has topped the national polls throughout most of the race for the Republican nomination, and has won more delegates than any other Republican so far. A Reuters/Ipsos online poll from April 4-8 showed that 42 percent of Republicans support Trump, compared with 32 percent for U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and 20 percent for Ohio Governor John Kasich. [L2N17B1J0] Cruz and Kasich have both said their paths to victory rely on winning at least enough votes to block an outright win for Trump and force a decision at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. But Trump, whose supporters have remained loyal even as he rankled women, Hispanics, Muslims, veterans and others with his fiery rhetoric on the campaign trail, predicted last month there would be riots outside the convention if he was blocked. “If they broker him out, I’ll be fed up with the Republicans,” said Chuck Thompson, 66, a Trump supporter from Concord, North Carolina, who took the poll. Thompson, a lifelong Republican, said he admires Trump’s independence from big campaign donors and takes that as a sign that the front-runner will be able to think for himself if he were to become president. If Trump loses the nomination, Thompson said he would quit the party. “The people want Donald Trump. If they (Republicans) can’t deal with that, I don’t need them,” he said. Green said the departure of even a small number of Republicans would make it tough for the party to prevent the Democrats from winning the White House, especially if the election is again decided by razor-thin margins in a handful of battleground states. In 2012, President Barack Obama won Florida by less than 1 percentage point and Ohio and Virginia by less than 4 percentage points. “The Republicans don’t really have any margin of error,” Green said. Trump and Cruz both trail Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton among likely general election voters in a hypothetical general election matchup, but not by much, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos polls. Generally, a convention battle is a bad sign for the health of a political party, said Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of the book, “Primary Politics: How Presidential Candidates Have Shaped the Modern Nominating System.” “When a party gets to a point when it has a contested convention, it almost always hurts them,” Kamarck said. “It’s a confirmation of some really deep fissures within the party that were unable to be dealt with during the primary season.” Trump supporter Elizabeth Oerther, 40, of Louisville, Kentucky, said she would switch parties and vote for the Democratic nominee if the Republicans denied Trump the nomination. “If you don’t give it to him, I’m going to vote against them,” said Oerther, who took the poll. “They want to take away the choice of the people. That’s wrong.”",1,fakenewsnet,,Exclusive: Blocking Trump could hurt Republicans in election - Reuters/Ipsos poll

"While Republicans continue to reveal their true colors by openly complaining about the release of American prisoners in Iran, President Obama is using his latest diplomatic success to teach his critics a lesson in what effective leadership really looks like.Obama had deliberately waited to talk about the hostage exchange until the American prisoners were out of Iran and safe, but upon news that the swap was a success and that the United Nations had certified that Iran was upholding its end of a landmark nuclear disarmament deal, the White House held a press conference that quickly turned into a teachable moment for those who had irresponsibly advocated for war over diplomacy. This is a good day, because once again we re seeing what s possible with strong American diplomacy, Obama said at the White House. Yesterday marked a milestone in preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, he noted. Most of important of all, we achieved this historic progress through diplomacy, without resorting to another war in the Middle East. And yet, somebody might want to tell the Republican Party that a victory like this without a single shot fired is considered a good thing. The friends at Fox and Friends were practically despondent when they had to tell their audience that the American prisoners in Iran were coming home.A good day for America is a bad one for Fox.Obama s negotiations were a massive blow to their narrative.For years, Republicans have insisted that the only way to get Iran to listen to the United States is through threats of war. Infamously, Republican Sen. John McCain ran for president on the platform of bomb, bomb, bomb, Iran. Even now, certain conservatives regret not being able to send troops into another Middle Eastern conflict. War is a tough addiction to kick.Nobody knows how much Republicans want war than President Obama. He s been boxing out the war-mongers for years. During his comments, he took a dig at those who say war is the only answer.Citing the cooling of tensions with Iran, Obama pointed out that his smart, patient and disciplined approach to the world has yielded results. America can do and has done big things when we work together, Obama said. We can lead this world and make it safer and more secure. But we can only do that if we stop listening to those who think threatening violence will make us look tough. America has tried that approach for decades and the situation with Iran had only been deteriorating. The change in recent months cannot be overstated.The nuclear talks have brought a sense of normalcy to relations with the U.S. and Iran, with top officials from each country in somewhat regular communication. While Obama emphasized that the U.S. continues to have deep concerns about Iran s destabilizing actions in the Middle East and its threats to Israel, he also opened up the prospect of Tehran working more cooperatively with the rest of the world.It s worth noting that those who want war with Iran represent a small minority of Americas mostly Republican politicians and Fox News hosts. It s not a coincidence that McCain s bomb Iran campaign strategy contributed to his being absolutely smoked by Obama s smart, patient and disciplined one in the election. It s also not a big secret that Americans are tired of sending young kids off to die in intractable wars in the Middle East. With the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan finally winding down, it s only those in the GOP who seem eager to embark on a new one.If accomplishing America s goals of neutralizing Iran s nuclear program while avoiding war was the goal and for most of the country, it was then this deal represents a massive success for the country. For the bloodthirsty, it probably stings a little. Obama s clearly not sorry.[youtube image via White House",0,fakenewsnet,, Victorious Obama Schools GOP War-Mongers: Breakthrough With Iran Based On ‘Smart’ Diplomacy (VIDEO)

"The new, ridiculous anti-LGBT law that Mississippi just passed and signed into law is not only discriminatory, but the opposite of freedom despite being labeled a religious freedom law. The only freedom it grants is for religious zealots to legally discriminate and fire people for being gay, as well as turn them away from their businesses, very reminiscent of Jim Crow era laws.Knowing how horrific these sort of laws are, and being on the receiving end of being fired for being gay, Ellen DeGeneres took a moment on her show to talk about the new Mississippi law. She said she s not a political person, but stated when I see something wrong, I have to talk about it, so she did.Ellen said of the law: It s the very definition of discrimination. It s also something that the Supreme Court already ruled on when they made marriage a right for everyone, everyone. Then jokingly added: They re Supreme. I mean, that s the best you can get. Like the Nacho Supreme from Taco Bell. However, she took a very serious tone talking about her own experiences being discriminated against, but coming out on top in the end. If you re in Mississippi or North Carolina or anywhere and you re saddened by the fact that people are judging you based on who you love, don t lose hope. I was fired for being gay, and I know what it feels like. I lost everything. But look at me now. The crowd then erupts into cheers, with Ellen perfectly adding: I could buy that governor s mansion, flip it, and make a $7 million dollar profit. But really driving home the point that what we really, truly need in this world is less hate and more love. And she couldn t be more right.Thank you, Ellen.

"Another conservative Christian pastor is praising the killing of 49 people who were shot at an Orlando gay nightclub last weekend.In response to Sacramento Pastor Roger Jimenez lamenting that the Orlando shooter didn t kill every last person in the club that night and calling for the government to line every gay person in America against a wall and execute them via firing squad, Fort Worth Pastor Donnie Romero of the Stedfast Baptist Church applauded the hateful sermon and added his sickening two cents.Romero claimed that all gay people are pedophiles even though that s a complete and utter lie, and he asked God to finish the job and kill any of the wounded victims who are still in the hospital. These 50 Sodomites were all perverts and pedophiles and they are the scum of the earth and the earth is a little bit better place now, and I ll even take it a little further I heard on the news today that there are still several dozen of these q****s in ICU and I will pray that God will finish the job that that man started, that he will end their lives and by tomorrow morning they will all be burning in hell so that they don t get any more opportunities to go out and hurt little children. Here s the video of the full sermon via YouTube if you can stomach it. The remarks above are at the beginning of the video.Romero was also echoing Arizona pastor Steven Anderson, who also had no sympathy or compassion for his fellow human beings and also called for all gays people to be executed.In an interview with Fox 4 about his hateful remarks, Romero showed no regret whatsoever. The Bible teaches they are predators, and I believe that every Sodomite is a pedophile and is a predator, Romero said.But Fox 4 also consulted a Bible scholar, who made it clear that Romero knows nothing about the book or Christianity. No Christian who has any formal understanding of the interaction between the Old and the New Testament would say such a thing, said theologian Steve Kellmeyer, He s just one more in a long list of people who don t get what it means to be Christian. It s disgusting how so-called men of God have been reacting to this tragedy all week long since it happened. The way they are cheering this loss of life makes them no better than ISIS, whose leaders we all know must be praising this attack just as fervently. These people who dare to call themselves Christians have thrown in with the terrorists against American citizens and that should not go unpunished. Each of these churches should lose their tax exemptions and be shut down for inciting hate crimes against the LGBT community.And if conservatives are still wondering why more people are rejecting religion today, they should look no further than these fundamentalist pastors they have allowed to lace Christianity with hate and violence.Featured image via screen capture",0,fakenewsnet,," WATCH: Texas Pastor Cheers Orlando Mass Shooting, Prays God Will Finish Off Those In ICU"

"DAKAR (Reuters) - A dormant Senegalese rebel movement has called for the abandonment of a planned mineral sands project operated by Australia-listed Astron, saying it amounts to a declaration of war . A spokesman for the Movement of Democratic Forces for Casamance (MFDC) on Thursday said that it had not been consulted about the project and considers any exploitation of natural resources in the southern region as theft because taxes on proceeds would go to the northern government of Dakar. The opposition to the Niafarang mine comes as the stable West African fish and peanut exporter seeks to boost revenue from natural resources such as mineral sands containing zircon and ilmenite used in construction as well as recently discovered oil and gas. Both the political and armed wings of the MFDC are strongly opposed to this project and consider it a declaration of war, said MFDC spokesman Oumar Ampoi Bodian by telephone from Ziguinchor in Casamance. The comments echoed a statement by MFDC military commander Salif Sadio in July. Sadio had said that the mineral sands project was a violation of the terms of the ceasefire deal with the rebels in 2014. Astron did not respond to emailed requests for comment. It said in June, when the contract was awarded, that work was due to begin in the fourth quarter of 2017. [nFWN1JC0OG] A government spokesman could not be reached for comment. Unlike many of its West African neighbors, Senegal has never had a civil war or a coup and is seen by Western aid partners and investors as a bastion of stability in a fragile region. But Casamance s isolation from the relatively rich Muslim north from which it is divided by Gambia and its eponymous river remains a source of resentment for locals. One of Africa s oldest rebellions was losing steam even before the ceasefire deal and some diplomats dismiss them as a divided group of rag-tag fighters. Yet the rebels still hold garrisons concealed within the southern region s lush forests, which witnesses say are piled high with weapons. Civil society groups have also criticized the mine planned along a picturesque strip of coastline, citing environmental factors. Astron previously said it had studied the environmental impact and engaged with the local community. They (the MFDC) are united on this and are saying it publicly, so I am afraid that this long period of calm could end, said Ousmane Sane, a resident and hotelier in Niafarang. A source familiar with the peace talks said that the matter would be raised with the government in the next round of negotiations aimed at settling the question of the region s official status.",1,fakenewsnet,,Senegal rebels issue warning over Astron's mineral sands mine

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two prominent U.S. Democratic senators are raising questions about President Donald Trump’s special adviser, Carl Icahn, asking in a letter on Thursday if the activist investor is attempting to persuade the government to lift its “too big to fail” tag from insurer American International Group. On Friday, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, comprising the chiefs of U.S. financial regulatory agencies, will discuss AIG’s designation as a “systemically important financial institution,” commonly known as one that is “too big to fail.” In an agenda for the meeting, the council did not say which institution it will discuss. However, there are only two non-banks designated as so large and interconnected that they would ruin the financial system if they failed - AIG and Prudential Insurance (PRU.N). The labels trigger stricter oversight and greater capital requirements. Trump has ordered a review of the designation process, currently at the heart of a lawsuit involving MetLife Inc. (MET.N), which many expect will lead his administration to rescind the current designations to try to lighten regulation it considers burdensome. In a letter to U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Sheldon Whitehouse said Icahn has retained “his massive business interests” while advising Trump on regulation, including his sizable investment in AIG (AIG.N). AIG company received a $182 billion taxpayer bailout during the 2007-09 financial crisis, which prompted Congress to call for the designations of non-banks in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law as systemically important. Icahn owned a 4.95 percent stake in AIG as of March 31. Concerned about compliance costs, Icahn had publicly pressed AIG to shrink, and tried to convince the FSOC that AIG no longer qualified for the label. Recently though, after AIG sold some assets and appointed a new chief executive, Icahn has not pushed the issue further. Senators Warren and Whitehouse also noted Icahn met with one current FSOC member, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Jay Clayton, after Clayton was nominated for the position. “Given Mr. Icahn’s recent modification of his position on the breakup of AIG, and his past interactions with administration officials, we write to seek assurances that Mr. Icahn has not provided input on or received information on the pending FSOC decision on AIG’s SIFI status,” they said. The two senators asked about any FSOC measures to ensure individuals with an interest in its decisions do not inappropriately influence its members. They also asked if any members are subject to recusal on AIG because of interactions with Icahn, and about any staff-level conversations regarding Icahn’s investments. AIG declined to comment, and the White House and Treasury did not respond to requests for comment.",1,fakenewsnet,,Senators concerned Icahn is influencing regulators on AIG

"Imagining what Donald Trump would be like as the next president of the United States is terrifying for every level-headed American. In fact, most of us don t even want to think about what it would be like.Bill Maher gave us an awful dose of reality on Real Time last night, when he imagined what a State of the Union address from the current Republican presidential front runner might look like. The enactment was prefaced with Maher pointing out the irony of Trump s complaints that former Mexican President Vicente Fox had used foul language to fire back at him after he pledged to make Mexico pay for the construction of his beloved U.S.-Mexico border wall if he became president. Fox s amazing response to that was I m not going to pay for the f*cking wall and he refused to comply when Trump demanded an apology for the comment.Amused with Trump s complete lack of self-awareness, Maher quipped on his show: Donald Trump must admit that, of all his reversals, hypocrisies, and 180s, his condemnation this week of Vicente Fox for using foul language is the most ridiculous of all. Talk about the pot calling the kettle orange. As Maher rolls footage of the Republican front runner cursing in several public speeches, the fact that Trump is pretending to be offended by Fox becomes even more hilarious.Maher then moved on to tackle Trump s disturbing popularity with the use of his alias, Andrew Dice Trump . Maher commented that the reason Trump had risen so high was because voters like his crass way of speaking. Maher remarked, They kind of like it when a politician drops the facade and talks the way we all really talk. And to explore just what a future Trump presidency might look like, Maher acted out a State of The Union address to show just how political discourse could go if America doesn t wake up soon and realize that we re better than bigotry and outlandish comments. Assuming the position of Trump in the scene, Maher cursed his entire way through the distasteful address and announced that the state of our union is f*cking awesome. Sadly, Maher captured Trump perfectly and this is probably a very realistic representation of what a speech by President Trump might look like.

The Amish are one of the fastest-growing religious groups in North America, Ohio State researcher Joseph Donnermeyer, who led the census project, said in a statement. They re doubling their population about every 21 to 22 years, primarily because they produce large families and the vast majority of daughters and sons remain in the community as adults baptized into the faith, starting their own families and sustaining their religious beliefs and practices.

Meanwhile, the Republicans did exactly what they always do they splintered, they argued amongst themselves, and they waited until the 11th hour to get behind Roy Moore, the Republican candidate who was accused (without evidence) by several women (one of whom admitted to committing forgery in a high school yearbook used as evidence of her claim against him) of sexual misconduct several decades ago. The media will try to blame this loss on President Trump, but the truth of the matter is, that the Republican Party came late to the game with funding and with support for Roy Moore, while half of the party either sat on their hands or openly condemned their candidate. The spineless Republican Party can take credit for the historic loss tonight in Alabama.AP In a stunning victory aided by scandal, Democrat Doug Jones won Alabama s special Senate election on Tuesday, beating back history, an embattled Republican opponent and President Donald Trump, who urgently endorsed GOP rebel Roy Moore despite a litany of sexual misconduct allegations.It was the first Democratic Senate victory in a quarter-century in Alabama, one of the reddest of red states, and proved anew that party loyalty is anything but sure in the age of Trump. It was a major embarrassment for the president and a fresh wound for the nation s already divided Republican Party.A number of Republicans declined to support him, including Alabama s long-serving Sen.

"Not every Hollywood actor is a liberal nut job with no understanding of the real world the rest of us are living in some of them, like actor Michael Enright are actually heros Michael Enright is one of the several hundred Westerners who have traveled to Iraq and Syria to join Kurdish combat units and fight the Islamic State.He s an unusual volunteer in several respects: he s 51 years old, the first time he handled a gun was at a shooting range right before he left for Syria, and he is almost certainly the only YPG fighter who has appeared in movies with Tom Cruise and Johnny Depp. Enright was in good spirits when he talked with the UK Daily Mail over the weekend about his decision to take up arms against ISIS and his experiences in Syria thus far. He does not seem to have received any special treatment from the Kurdish YPG militia due to his pre-war occupation and connections with celebrities, and he does not want any. He is not looking to hold down a desk at some Kurdish media office; he came to fight. Where I m going in the next two days, say a prayer for me, because I ll be going to a place which has a lot of action, a lot of fighting, he told the Daily Mail. He has already done a month s worth of guard duty on the front lines, watching coalition fighter jets attack ISIS forces.He would like to see a bit more of that, he says. The Daily Mail describes Enright as angry that Britain is not bombing Islamic State targets in Syria, concentrating instead on Iraq. He thinks the Kurds could defeat ISIS in Syria with more air cover. We re out gunned, and we re out manned. We need the air support, he said.Enright s story is breathtaking in its simplicity: he beheld the horrors of ISIS and felt it was his duty to his native Britain, the America where he prospered, and the victims of Islamic State atrocities to do something about it. Fortunately, he had a friend in the British SAS who could put him in touch with the Kurdish YPG militia. He made his arrangements quietly, without telling family or friends, because he feared they would try to talk him out of it. He brought everyone in his life up to speed with a Facebook post after he arrived in Syria. For me, the biggest regret of my life was not going to Afghanistan when 9/11 happened, he told the Daily Mail. The beheading videos brought out the same kind of feelings in me, and a real sense that I had a duty to America. I really feel a debt to the country. You know, they welcomed me with open arms. And then what added to it all was that it was an Englishman, that he had an English accent, Enright continued, referring to Jihadi John, the British-expatriate host of many beheading videos. And I just, it just touched me personally, in a very deep way. He said the last straw was ISIS burning captured Jordanian pilot Mu ath al-Kassasbeh alive in a cage. He watches that video on his smartphone whenever he needs a jolt of motivation for his military duties.It is not ironic or sarcastic to say that Enright s journey would make an amazing movie; his story of trying to hook up with YPG contacts in Iraqi Kurdistan is as harrowing as anything you ll find in an espionage thriller. His training alongside Kurdish fighters, as a gentleman of a certain age without any prior military experience, would make for a fine bit of action-comedy: imagine the Kurdish equivalent of R. Lee Ermey screaming, You think you re special because you were in a Pirates of the Caribbean movie, maggot? Drop and gimme fifty! There is no sense whatsoever that he is thinking along those lines. (For the record, Enright describes his training as a combination of weapons drills, language classes, and running up and down hills, basically. To his surprise, he turned out to be a naturally gifted rifleman. He sleeps alongside his AK-47, which he has named Olga. )Enright is very serious about what he is doing, well aware of the risks he s taking, and conscious of all that he left behind, including a sister who was recently diagnosed with cancer. She s going through radiotherapy right now, he said. And so I m just hoping that we both get through it. To borrow a line from a previous generation of men who answered the call to battle, Enright won t be coming home until it s over, over there. He said he s not homesick after two months in the country. I m very happy to be here, to be doing something that I think will outlast me, he declared.Enright described ISIS as an abomination and said their atrocities were a call to humanity, it s a call to everybody, to do whatever we can, in whatever way we can. He said he wants to absolutely annihilate them, and kill them on sight. Whether or not he winds up documenting his experiences in Hollywood film, he has no intention of appearing in any Islamic State beheading videos. He is well aware of the terror state s $100,000 bounty for Western hostages and says he keeps a bullet in reserve for himself, in case he s about to be captured.

"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The International Criminal Court approved a prosecution request on Thursday to investigate war crimes allegedly committed in Burundi by the government and government-linked groups against political foes from April 2015 to October 2017. The decision follows Burundi s decision to withdraw from the court as of Oct. 26, 2017. However, the court will still have jurisdiction over crimes committed while Burundi was a member. A court statement said the country s government launched a widespread and systematic attack against the Burundian civilian population... targeting those who opposed or were perceived to oppose the ruling party. In a statement, the court said the prosecutor had presented enough evidence of crimes against humanity to merit a formal investigation, including murder, torture, rape and persecution, that led to more than 1,000 deaths. Unrest has gripped Burundi since the announcement, in April 2015, that President Pierre Nkurunziza would seek a third term in office. He won in July of that year, despite protests that the vote was rigged and that his seeking a third term violated both the constitution and the terms of an agreement that had ended a previous rebellion. UN rights investigators and independent activists have accused government forces of widespread violations, including forced disappearances, and of orchestrating a campaign of terror. Around 400,000 people have fled to neighboring countries amid the unrest, which has crippled Burundi s economy. Reacting to the court decision, top Nkurunziza adviser Willy Nyamitwe tweeted: The corrupt ICC just shot itself in the foot.

"After a whole week off, and an emotional tribute from Hillary Clinton s portrayer, Kate McKinnon, Alec Baldwin will return to Saturday Night Live as Donald Trump. Baldwin s portrayal of Trump was one of the larger bright spots in an otherwise infuriating and frustrating election cycle, and now that Trump has won the election, Baldwin s reprisal should be a welcome break from all the hate and fear Trump has unleashed.SNL has actually taken quite a bit of flak for portraying Trump and Hillary as equally bad candidates. That will change now, and who knows how. SNL can be quite unpredictable, and given Trump s, ahem, ascendancy, Weekend Update s Colin Jost said: Now it seems easier, in a way, to tell jokes about what Trump s doing specifically because he s in power. If [the candidates] are talking about what they re going to do, it s harder to criticize it than when you start seeing what they re actually doing or not doing. Trump is making white supremacists and other extremists members of his administration right now. He won t like whatever SNL does with him unless Baldwin fawns over him, which is very unlikely. Barring a love fest from the show, Trump will probably downright hate it. He hated it before and tried to convince people that SNL was in on the efforts to rig the election against him:Watched Saturday Night Live hit job on me.Time to retire the boring and unfunny show. Alec Baldwin portrayal stinks. Media rigging election! Donald J. Trump October 16, 2016Maybe now he ll whine that they re trying to foment a rebellion or insurrection against him.Baldwin didn t play Trump the weekend following the election because he was booked, and because he s got small children at home.

That doesn t mean he doesn t enjoy doing it he just won t be doing it as much, though: I m going to do it again this weekend, but not all that often.

"ISTANBUL/NEW YORK (Reuters) - A trial which has strained Turkish-U.S. ties before it even started opens this week in New York despite the possible absence of a defendant who Turkey says is cooperating with prosecutors in what it calls a clear plot against Ankara. Turkish-Iranian gold trader Reza Zarrab, charged with conspiring to evade U.S. sanctions on Iran, has dropped out of sight in the last two months, prompting Turkey s prime minister to suggest he has reached a plea deal with U.S. authorities. James Margolin, a spokesman for U.S. prosecutors in Manhattan, declined to comment on whether Zarrab was cooperating with the authorities. A lawyer for Zarrab, Benjamin Brafman, declined to comment for this article. Zarrab and eight other people, including Turkey s former economy minister and three executives of Turkish state-owned Halkbank, have been charged with engaging in transactions worth hundreds of millions of dollars for Iran s government and Iranian entities from 2010 to 2015 in a scheme to evade U.S. sanctions. Only Zarrab and Mehmet Hakan Atilla, one of the Halkbank executives, have been arrested by U.S. authorities. Ex-minister Zafer Caglayan, who has not been arrested by the United States and remains in Turkey, is also accused of receiving tens of millions of dollars in bribes from the proceeds of the scheme. The Turkish government has said he acted within Turkish and international law. Caglayan, Zarrab and Atilla have denied all the charges against them. Victor Rocco, a lawyer for Atilla, declined to comment on the case. Caglayan could not be reached for comment. Halkbank says all its transactions fully comply with Turkish and international regulations. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan s government has said the case has been fabricated for political motives. The tensions it has exacerbated between Ankara and Washington - NATO allies - have hit investor sentiment toward Turkey, and traders say it has also contributed to the lira s fall to record lows. U.S. prosecutors claim that the defendants helped Zarrab use his network of companies to supply currency and gold to the Iranian government and Iranian entities, violating U.S. sanctions. The prosecutors have alleged that the defendants used front companies and fake invoices to trick U.S. banks into processing transactions disguised to appear as though they involved food, which is exempt from the sanctions. Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said the charges were baseless, and that Turkey had not violated its own or international laws regarding exports and trade. The Zarrab case is a clear plot against Turkey, a political case and lacking any legal basis, government spokesman Bekir Bozdag said last week. Zarrab has been absent from recent court hearings. Last month Atilla s lawyers said Zarrab, who was arrested in Miami in March 2016, had essentially not participated in the case and that Atilla might be the only defendant appearing at trial. The defendants in the case are under pressure and being forced to make statements against our country, Yildirim said, without explanation. The case is acutely sensitive in Turkey because the prosecutors say a Turkish government minister, Caglayan, was involved in the alleged conspiracy to evade the U.S. sanctions. In a filing four weeks ago, prosecutors also included the transcript of an April 16, 2013 recorded phone call in which a speaker they identified as Zarrab discussed with another co-defendant his efforts to buy a bank to establish a conduit for Iranian transactions. Prosecutors said Zarrab and Erdogan, then Turkey s prime minister, had spoken four days earlier at a wedding. I explained it that day at the wedding, Zarrab told the co-defendant, according to prosecutors. I will go back and will say, Mr. Prime Minister, if you approve, give me a license . Erdogan has not been accused of any wrongdoing, but has repeatedly expressed frustration with the case. You arrest the general manager of my bank when there are no crimes, try to use my citizen (Zarrab) as an informant, try him without having anything against him, Erdogan said in a speech to provincial governors on Oct. 12, in an apparent reference to the U.S. prosecutors. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu has said he sees in this case the hand of U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen. Erdogan accuses Gulen of masterminding last year s failed military coup in Turkey and also of driving an earlier legal case involving Zarrab. In that earlier case, Turkish prosecutors accused Zarrab and high-ranking Turkish officials of involvement in facilitating Iranian money transfers via gold smuggling. After details of the Turkish prosecution were leaked in 2013, several prosecutors were removed from the case and police investigators were reassigned. Erdogan branded the case an attempt by Gulen s supporters to undermine his government and the investigation was later dropped. Cavusoglu said the two legal cases were exactly the same , and showed the extent to which Gulen had infiltrated American state institutions, including its judiciary. Needless to say, those claims are ridiculous, acting U.S. Attorney Joon Kim said last week. The case has been handled by career prosecutors concerned only with U.S. law, not Turkish politics, Kim said, adding: They re not Gulenists. Gulen denies involvement in the failed 2016 coup or any other attempts to undermine Erdogan and his government. The Zarrab case is one of several festering disputes between Ankara and Washington, which disagree over U.S. support for Kurdish fighters in Syria and suspended visa services after the arrest of a locally employed U.S. consulate worker in Istanbul last month. In a speech on Wednesday, Yildirim highlighted the economic fallout from the court hearings, saying they had come to the point of harming Turkey and our global economic ties . Turkey s bank regulator denied a report in Haberturk newspaper last month that six unnamed Turkish banks could face fines worth billions of dollars over Iran sanctions violations. Investors are nervous. Turkish bank shares have fallen more than 13 percent in November, nearly twice the decline of the broader Istanbul market. Jury selection is due to start on Monday, meaning the trial may begin as early as Tuesday.",1,fakenewsnet,,Gold trader's trial strains U.S.-Turkey relations

"(Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Wednesday blocked a bill that would nullify state and local efforts to require food makers to label products made with genetically modified organisms, or GMOs, as the industry races to stop Vermont’s law from taking effect on July 1. The proposed legislation from Republican Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas comes amid growing calls for transparency in the U.S. food supply. Labeling advocates have criticized the bill as toothless because it leaves the decision to disclose GMO ingredients to the companies whose products contain them. Senate Bill 2609 is known as the Biotech Labeling Solutions Act by supporters and the Deny Americans the Right to Know, or DARK, Act by opponents. A procedural vote on Wednesday failed to reach the necessary 60 votes to advance the bill in the Senate, with 49 yes votes and 48 no votes. Roberts vowed to keep fighting as the July 1 deadline looms for Vermont’s labeling requirement to take effect. “I remain at the ready to work on a solution,” Roberts said. The United States is the world’s largest market for foods made with genetically altered ingredients. Many popular processed foods are made with soybeans, corn and other biotech crops whose genetic traits have been manipulated, often to make them resistant to insects and pesticides. Major food, farm and biotech seed companies spent more than $100 million in the United States last year to battle labeling efforts, according to a lobbying disclosure analysis from the Environmental Working Group, which opposes the Senate measure. Opponents to GMO labeling efforts include trade groups such as the Grocery Manufacturers Association, whose members have included PepsiCo Inc and Kellogg Co, and BIO, which counts Monsanto Co, Dow AgroSciences, a unit of Dow Chemical Co, and other companies that sell seeds that produce GMO crops among its members. They say labeling would impose speech restrictions on food sellers, burden consumers with higher costs and create a patchwork of state GMO labeling policies that have “no basis in health, safety or science.” But companies such as Whole Foods Market Inc, Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc and Campbell Soup Co already have begun labeling or abandoning GMOs rather than waiting for government action.",1,fakenewsnet,,Senate blocks bill that would override state GMO labeling laws

"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Several lawmakers filed family history documents in Australia s parliament to meet a government deadline on Tuesday to try to prove their citizenship and stem a crisis that has so far claimed nine MPs and cost the government its majority. Australia s 116-year-old constitution bans dual citizens from holding national office and the High Court adopted a strict interpretation of it in October in a country where half the population were either born overseas or have a parent who was. The crisis may yet plunge Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull s Liberal-National coalition into minority rule, should it lose another lawmaker, or a crucial by-election set for Dec. 19. The ruling center-right pairing lost its one-seat lower-house majority when the High Court found Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce to be a New Zealander and therefore ineligible for office. He has since rescinded his New Zealand citizenship and regained his seat in parliament. But another member has since quit his place and now as many as a dozen more now face referral to the court after the deadline to disclose the birthplace of parents and grandparents passed on Tuesday. The disclosures show that nearly every lawmaker has at least one foreign parent or grandparent. While some provide citizenship records dating back to the 19th century, others give few details or documents, prompting calls for the High Court to consider their cases. There are a few grey areas, there s no doubt about that, MP Christopher Pyne said on Perth radio station 6PR, adding that parliament would decide on Thursday which cases to send to the court. One opposition Labor Party member has already told parliament it remains unclear whether he is British, after the Home Office could not find the paperwork to prove he renounced his citizenship a decade ago. Labor argues that seven government lawmakers filed unconvincing or incomplete disclosures, while the government raised doubts over four opposition MPs, and there is a cloud over another independent lawmaker.

"For the second time in the last ten days, slimy and loathsome Ted Cruz totally botched another painful impression of the late President Kennedy.You might recall how Cruz first performed a painfully awkward rendition of the Miracle Max scene from the beloved film The Princess Bride, thus nearly ruining the film for all time. There s something wrong in the universe when someone as repugnant as Cruz likes such a fantastic movie to the point where he can recite entire passages in the voices of the characters. The voices were, of course, terrible and he got many of the lines wrong, which once again verified that most conservatives shouldn t bother trying to be funny. They re never funny, even when the source material is stellar.Then, earlier this month, Cruz entertained a small crowd of Iowa yokels with a flop-sweat inducing JFK impression, just after suggesting Kennedy would be driven out of the modern Democratic Party for being too conservative. Regarding the latter, no. First, Kennedy was arguably more liberal than most Democratic leaders of 2016. Second, there are moderate and conservative Democrats who continue to be welcome in the party, including presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton.It s also worth noting that Cruz fumbled the quote. The line he attributed to JFK was actually said by Robert Kennedy years after JFK was assassinated. RFK s line, which was cribbed from George Bernard Shaw, by the way, went: Some people see things as they are and say why. I dream things that never were and say why not? And this is the line Cruz used for his John Kennedy impression.He did it again on Monday.Cruz s verbatim line: During the 1960s, I will point out that one of the most powerful, eloquent defenders of tax cuts was John F. Kennedy. As JFK said, Some men see things as they are and ask, Why? I see things that never were and ask, why not? These are the principles that work. Once again, it was RFK who popularized the line. Not JFK. And no one noticed.Cruz also said that JFK was a champion of tax cuts. This, believe it or not, is mostly true. Kennedy proposed fairly deep cuts to the marginal tax rates at a time when the top bracket was nearly three times higher than it is today.But that wouldn t have forced him out of today s Democratic Party. How do we know this? President Obama is responsible for the biggest middle class tax cut in American history. That s no exaggeration. The infamous stimulus bill, which almost entirely helped to keep the economy from sliding into a Depression, included $282 billion in tax cuts. As a point of comparison, President Bush s tax cuts amounted to roughly $174 billion. Obama s tax cut was also larger than Reagan s cuts.So, Mr. Cruz continues to lie to his people, assuming they re too ignorant to know the difference between JFK and RFK, or the difference between Obama and Kennedy on tax cuts.[youtube image via video screen grab.",0,fakenewsnet,, Ted Cruz Repeated His Truly Horrible JFK Impression And Got The Quote Wrong.

"TBILISI (Reuters) - Georgian President Giorgi Margvelashvili on Monday vetoed a draft new constitution and sent it back to parliament with his objections which included opposing its call for an end to direct elections for president. Parliament, which is dominated by the Georgian Dream Party, adopted the new draft last week over objections from Margvelashvili and the opposition. Under this new proposed new constitution, direct elections for president would be abolished from 2024, the country would transfer to full proportional parliamentary representation and the system of electoral blocs would be scrapped. In a televised statement, Margvelashvili, who was elected in 2013 for a five-year term, said he remained in favor of direct presidential elections rather than a system in which the president would be appointed by parliament. He said he had proposed to the parliamentary majority to allow parties to form electoral blocs for the next parliamentary elections in 2020. He said he also supported scrapping the voting bonus system under which votes of parties that failed to muster enough support to enter parliament would be transferred to the winner of the election. He also supported a switch to a proportional electoral system in 2020. I will send my justified objection to the parliament today, Margvelashvili said. The next presidential election in Georgia is to be held in 2018 and it is not clear whether Margvelashvili, who is at odds with the ruling party on several issues, will stand again. MPs from the Georgian Dream said after adopting the new constitution that they would give ground on only two of the president s objections allowing the parties to form electoral blocs and scrapping the voting bonus system.

"A number of European politicians, including Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the top eurozone official, have said a no vote would jeopardize Greece s place in the 19-nation eurozone. Investors are also likely to believe a no win increases the chance of a so-called Grexit , where Greece returns to its own old currency. ATHENS, Greece (AP) Greeks overwhelmingly rejected creditors demands for more austerity in return for rescue loans in a critical referendum Sunday, backing Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, who insisted the vote would give him a stronger hand to reach a better deal.Tsipras gambled the future of his 5-month-old left-wing government on the vote. The opposition accused him of jeopardizing the country s membership in the 19-nation club that uses the euro and said a yes vote was about keeping the common currency.With 70 percent of the votes counted, the no side had more than 60 percent. The interior ministry predicted that margin would hold.Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis said Sunday night that creditors planned from the start to shut down banks to humiliate Greeks and force them to make a statement of contrition for showing that debt and loans are unsustainable.On Sunday night s result, he said that no is a big `yes to democratic Europe. It s a no to the vision of Europe an infinite cage for its people. It is a loud yes to the vision of the Eurozone as a common area of prosperity and social justice.

"Pro man-made climate change, RINO Lindsay Graham, who never saw a war he didn t want to engage our troops in, joins his war hawk, RINO, anti-Trumper friend John McCain (who got crushed by Obama in the 2008 Presidential election), to call for investigations into Russian influence in our November elections. John McCain withdrew his support for Trump after the bad words he used in a private conversation with another guy. Lindsey Graham got crushed by Trump in the primaries and was a loud voice against his nomination. He eventually changed his mind and offered his support for Trump in the general election against Hillary. John McCain did not change his mind.The recount is over, but there s still time to discredit the legitimacy of Donald J. Trump s landslide election. Who better to help the Democrats, than two RINO s who are at the top of the heap when it comes to draining useless Republicans from the swamp. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham (R) said Wednesday he would lead a charge to investigate Russia s interference in the U.S. election and hacks on the Democratic Party. I think [Donald] Trump should take a real tough tone with Russia, because if he doesn t, you re going to allow Russia to begin to break apart alliances, Graham told CNN s Manu Raju.The Republican senator also said he hoped to use his leadership role on two subcommittees to launch a deeper investigation of Russia s hacks, CNN reported. Graham chairs the State, Foreign Operations and Related Programs subcommittee and the Crime and Terrorism subcommittee.Raju said Graham told him that he and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), chair of the Armed Services Committee, will travel to Eastern Europe to investigate Russian meddling in other countries elections.During the campaign, Graham was a strong GOP critic of Trump, including on his friendlier stance toward Russia, and chose to vote instead for independent candidate Evan McMullin. The HillThe Obama administration clearly stated that they saw NO evidence of outside election tampering in the general election.On November 26, 2016 the Obama administration said it has seen no evidence of hackers tampering with the 2016 presidential election, even as recount proceedings began in Wisconsin. We stand behind our election results, which accurately reflect the will of the American people, a senior administration official told POLITICO late Friday. The federal government did not observe any increased level of malicious cyber activity aimed at disrupting our electoral process on election day, the official added. We believe our elections were free and fair from a cybersecurity perspective. Yet yesterday this story appeared in the New York Times: WASHINGTON American intelligence agencies have concluded with high confidence that Russia acted covertly in the latter stages of the presidential campaign to harm Hillary Clinton s chances and promote Donald J. Trump, according to senior administration officials.They based that conclusion, in part, on another finding which they say was also reached with high confidence that the Russians hacked the Republican National Committee s computer systems in addition to their attacks on Democratic organizations, but did not release whatever information they gleaned from the Republican networks.In the months before the election, it was largely documents from Democratic Party systems that were leaked to the public. Intelligence agencies have concluded that the Russians gave the Democrats documents to WikiLeaks.Republicans have a different explanation for why no documents from their networks were ever released. Over the past several months, officials from the Republican committee have consistently said that their networks were not compromised, asserting that only the accounts of individual Republicans were attacked. On Friday, a senior committee official said he had no comment.Donald Trump has said the CIA s conclusion that Russia interfered in the presidential election is ridiculous and being used by Democrats as just another excuse for his defeat of Hillary Clinton.The president-elect told Fox News Sunday that he did not necessarily oppose Barack Obama s order for a review of campaign-season cyber-attacks.But he added that in any such effort, you should not just say Russia . You should say other countries also, and maybe other individuals.

"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Venture capitalists and startup executives, who had mounted a campaign against a proposal to change how the federal government taxes stock options, expressed relief on Wednesday after the U.S. Senate dropped the measure from its tax overhaul plan. The Senate tax bill had proposed taxing employee stock options, a crucial part of compensation at technology startups, as they vest. Options generally vest over a four-year period. The result would have been annual tax bills for startup employees that soared into the tens of thousands of dollars, warned startup founders and employees. Startup options give employees the right to purchase shares in the future and are illiquid, meaning employees cannot spend or save their options. The Senate removed that provision late Tuesday night following heavy lobbying from the National Venture Capital Association, the industry trade group, and an outpouring of opposition from Silicon Valley venture capitalists and entrepreneurs. They predicted the demise of the startup industry should the tax become law. “The entrepreneurial ecosystem can breathe a sigh of relief,” said Bobby Franklin, president and chief executive of the trade association. More than 600 startups, investors and executives from companies such as Uber, Airbnb and Stripe signed a letter Tuesday to Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, urging him to remove the provision. “This shift would have profound negative consequences for technology startups by, among other things, undermining their ability to compete with large incumbents for employees,” they wrote in the letter, organized by technology advocacy group Engine. A spokesman for Hatch did not respond to a request for comment. The current tax code taxes employees only when they exercise their options. The Senate proposal would have required employees to pay regular income tax on the value gain of stock options even before cashing them in. The National Venture Capital Association (NVCA) was also successful in getting a similar proposal removed from the original House tax reform bill. “We don’t anticipate it coming back up again,” said Ben Veghte, spokesman for the NVCA. In the new version of the Senate bill, the finance committee also added language that would enable startup employees to defer for five years their stock options tax bill if they reach the deadline to exercise them but the company is still private and shares do not trade on the public markets. Venky Ganesan, managing director of Menlo Ventures, called the changes “consistent with economic growth and job creation.”",1,fakenewsnet,,Senate drops proposal to change taxes on startup stock options

"Donald Trump and his campaign have been scrambling to do damage control after his multiple attacks on the Khans, Gold Star parents whose Muslim son died fighting for his country. One of Trump s latest pathetic attempts to recover was to meet with Gold Star families so he could brag about it later.But MSNBC s Mika Brzezinski wasn t impressed, and was able to see right through Trump s act. In a segment about Trump s latest attempt to fool America, she had a direct message for Trump supporters: wake the f*** up. Brzezinski insisted that Trump s entire campaign was a scam and his meeting with these families was no different Trump was just trying to fool gullible Americans into believing that he cares about things other than himself.Visibly upset that a person running for president would do something so heartless and take advantage of trusting Americans this way, the MSNBC host said: I m just trying to because, look, Trump supporters, people who support Donald Trump, are people who should be respected for how they feel. Brzezinski became emotional several times while trying to beg Trump s supporters to be more critical. As her voice cracked with emotion, she continued: But I worry that they don t understand that they re being scammed, and they re being scammed by somebody who s really good at it, so it s not like, you know, it s their fault. But I will say that it s a scam, what Trump is selling. Remarking on just how heartless Trump s attacks had been on the Khans, Brzezinski urged voters not to be fooled. Talking to Gold Star families after the biggest gaffe in probably presidential politics, candidacy s history, what he did with the Khans he s just trying to clean up. I mean, do you want someone who speaks from the heart and says nothing or says anything, or do you want someone who speaks from the heart and has some principle behind it and sticks to his word? This is a scam, and it seems like he has a lot of followers.

"Fox Host Bret Baier found himself forced to retract a statement earlier today that claimed an indictment against Hillary Clinton was very likely because, well, he d pretty much lied and promptly got caught. But the FBI has been a sieve for information about Hillary lately, which is where Baier supposedly got some of his information, and it s time to ask why.One FBI agent, who spoke to The Guardian on the condition of anonymity, might have part of the answer. In fact, he just destroyed the bureau s reputation with his truth bomb about what s actually happening. According to this agent, the FBI is basically Trumplandia, in that the agency isn t anything like objective about its investigations into Hillary: The currently serving FBI agent said Clinton is the antichrist personified to a large swath of FBI personnel, and that the reason why they re leaking is they re pro-Trump.' Apparently, their attitudes only got worse when Director James Comey decided not to recommend indicting Hillary earlier this year. A lot of Trumpkins all over the country were angry about that, most likely because she s a woman, and a clear and present threat to their chosen candidate. The witch hunts have very little to do with actual evidence that she s a criminal.But it s not just Trumpkins that can t stand her whether they re Trumpkins or not, many in the FBI just have a very unfavorable view of Hillary. That, too, raises serious questions about the agency s integrity right now: There are lots of people who don t think Trump is qualified, but also believe Clinton is corrupt. What you hear a lot is that it s a bad choice, between an incompetent and a corrupt politician. The bureau has come under fire for its handling of these investigations, along with Comey s decision to send a letter to Congress about newly discovered emails just 11 days before the election. That alone was enough to give the impression that they re not objective, especially since Comey has refused to respond to that criticism.The Daily Beast also picked up on a story alleging that there are connections between Rudy Giuliani, who s got his head buried deep inside Trump s ass, and the New York City FBI office. That office pressed headquarters to continue looking into the matter of Hillary s emails after Comey declared the investigation effectively closed. Agents are pissed at Comey because they believe the failure to recommend indictment shook people s faith in the bureau.So the leaks from the bureau continue, and it s pretty clear now that the FBI is, in fact, on a witch hunt against Hillary rather than conducting legitimate investigations into legitimate problems. If anything is calling the FBI s integrity into question, it s this, rather than Comey s decision not to indict back in July.Image of Hillary Clinton by by Justin Sullivan, image of James Comey by Alex Wong, via Getty Images.",0,fakenewsnet,, FBI Agent Drops FATAL Truth Bomb About What The Bureau Is Doing To Hillary Clinton

As a campaign manager, wouldn t you want your candidate saying some of these things directly to the people he s supposedly addressing? Anderson Cooper asked. You know what s amazing to me, is no one remembers Donald Trump went to go have a rally in Chicago at the university, responded Lewandoski. And do you remember what happened? It was so chaotic, and it was so out of control, Secret Service and the Chicago Police Department told him you could not get in and out of that facility safely, and that rally was canceled. And you showed the footage many times of the individuals who attended that rally. Donald Trump had that rally booked, Lewandowski said. That is a black community. He went to the heart of Chicago to go and give a speech to the University of Chicago in a campus, which is predominantly African-American, to make that argument. And you know what happened? The campus was overrun, and it was not a safe environment, he said.Source: The HillThe rally Lewandowski was speaking of occurred in Chicago in March or rather, it didn t occur in Chicago in March because it was shut down over protests. The largely African-American protesters objected to the violence that has been occurring at Trump rallies, but I guess it s okay if white people are violent.Here s the video:Trump, who has a zero percent approval rating with African-Americans, is trying to appear less racist. Lewandowski isn t helping, but to be fair, neither is Trump. His African-American outreach has been nothing but empty, insulting attempts at pandering. It was Trump, not Lewandowski, who appeared on Bill O Reilly to say that he d give Chicago police carte blanche to do whatever it takes to stop black crime.Perhaps Trump should focus on the crimes that are taking place right under his nose, whether that be the violence at his rallies or the alleged crimes taking place right in his offices.Featured image via video screen capture.",0,fakenewsnet,, Former Trump Campaign Manager Says It’s Too Dangerous For Trump To Be Around Black People (VIDEO)

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A national association of U.S. venture capitalists filed suit against the Trump administration on Tuesday, claiming it illegally delayed a policy that would have allowed foreign entrepreneurs to stay in the United States to build their companies. The suit, filed in Washington, D.C. District Court by the National Venture Capital Association, argues that the Trump administration did not go through proper procedures when it delayed the Obama administration’s “International Entrepreneur” rule, which was due to go into effect in July and would have allowed some foreign start-up founders to stay in the United States for up to five years in hopes of growing their businesses. Instead, in July the Trump administration pushed back implementing the new rule to March 2018, and said it was “highly likely” the administration would ultimately rescind the rule. In delaying the program’s start date, the Department of Homeland Security did not engage in the standard “notice and comment” period government agencies typically go through when changing regulations, or a delayed effective date. The DHS argued in July that doing so while the agency was likely to abolish the rule would be contrary to the public interest because it would sow confusion and waste resources and mean the immigration agency would have to expend limited resources to implement the rule. The suit claims that the administration’s actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act, which requires advance notice of new rules, and asks the court to stop the government from delaying the new rule and instead require it to begin accepting applications from foreign entrepreneurs. “The process followed by DHS in deciding to delay the effective date of the rule was the polar opposite of the careful, deliberative process DHS used to formulate the rule itself,” the suit argued. A DHS spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the suit. The NVCA was joined in the suit by several tech start-ups active in the United States but founded by foreign entrepreneurs who wanted to be able to stay in the country and work with their businesses through the entrepreneur rule but are now unable to. The Obama administration estimated fewer than 3,000 entrepreneurs would be eligible for the program each year. The rule would have applied to start-up founders who own a large portion of their companies. To qualify, the companies have to have already received significant investment from American investors or government grants.",1,fakenewsnet,,Venture capitalists sue Trump admin over foreign entrepreneur rule delay

"Yet another conservative is openly expressing his support for the #NeverTrump movement and it s none other than Michael Reagan, the son of former President Ronald Reagan.On Monday, Michael took to Twitter to tell his followers that he would not be voting for The Donald on Tuesday, and that he firmly believes that his father would also refrain from voting for the business mogul if he was still alive. Of course, Reagan was immediately attacked by Trump s die-hard followers, who tried to argue his claim that the former President wouldn t have backed Trump if he were here today. Here s how that went:TwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterReagan is one of an overwhelming amount of Republicans abandoning the GOP solely because Donald Trump is the presumptive Republican nominee. No one can forget that when Trump was announced as the leader in the GOP race, conservatives all across the country reacted by burning and tearing up their voter registration cards. In some cases, GOP voters left their affiliation with the party altogether.Reagan has spoken against Trump before, with the assertion that his father would not approve of the business mogul being the GOP nominee. A few months ago, during an interview with Newsmax, Reagan slammed Trump s campaign, and the Republicans who support it: My father would be appalled by what s going on with this campaign. Are you a Trump Republican, or are you a Reagan Republican? Because you cannot be both. The words of Reagan s son are particularly humorous considering that Trump has compared himself to Reagan before, when he claimed he evoke[s] the name Ronald Reagan. Trump said on CBS s Face The Nation: Ronald Reagan was a fairly liberal Democrat, and he evolved over years and he became more and more conservative. And he was not a very conservative person, but he was pretty conservative. And he ended up being a great president. Clearly, no one else sees the similarities besides The Donald, and many GOPers such as Reagan s son don t have any faith in Trump to be a great president .Featured image via Wikimedia",0,fakenewsnet,, Reagan’s Son SLAMS Trump: If My Father Was Alive He Wouldn’t Vote For GOP Nominee (TWEETS)

"Now that Donald Trump is the presumptive GOP nominee, it s time to remember all those other candidates who tried so hard to beat him in the race to the White House. After all, how can we forget all the missteps, gaffes, weirdness, and sheer idiocies of such candidates as Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, John Kasich, Ted Cruz, Ben Carson, and Carly Fiorina?There s a video making the rounds on Twitter that does just that, and eulogizes three of these failed candidates as though they re dead (and the GOP itself might as well be dead at this point anyway). Appropriately titled, A Eulogy for the GOP, people make short speeches about each of these candidates.Once past the man who actually says Jeb Bush was qualified to be president, there are fake tears, with journalist and comedienne Francesca Fiorentini saying: Dearly beloved, we re gathered here today to commemorate the candidates that are no longer with us. One man, speaking to an amusing, circus-y rendition of Chopin s Funeral March, remembers Jeb this way: Jeb, we hardly knew ye. It s too bad that your policies couldn t find their way out of the Republican morass. Indeed, it was like Jeb and his policies were invisible sometimes, although many felt that he would win the nomination early on. His best performances often came during debates, when he d get into out-and-out fights with Donald Trump over virtually everything under the sun. He also had a bad habit of defending his brother s actions in Iraq, memorably saying, As it relates to my brother, there s one thing I know for sure: He kept us safe. Moving on to Marco Rubio, Fiorentini herself says: He was called so many things: Young, charming, Lil Marco.' That last nickname is, of course, a reference to Trump s penchant for name-calling. Then, a man speaking Spanish remembers Rubio this way: Marco, why aren t you a normal boy? Another said that his involvement in the Gang of Eight immigration bill killed him as a candidate, to which Fiorentini replies: Some people die of gang violence. He died of Gang of Eight violence. The makers of this video saved the absolute best for last, of course, which is Ben Carson. On our dear Dr. Carson, one of the speakers says: He would gently rock me to sleep with his monotone voice. Carson was especially well known for seemingly being asleep half the time. If we saw his eyes open wide, it was surprising, and likely because he was surprised himself. His voice is soft, his speech is slow, and it really can be hard to stay awake while he s talking.

"BERLIN (Reuters) - German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel has ordered a special inspection into past irregularities in billing of expenses at its embassy in Paris, but the ministry said it was not aware of similar problems at other embassies. Walter Lindner, a senior ministry official, disclosed the probe in a letter to Greens lawmaker Franziska Brantner in letter dated Friday, and said it could trigger new recommendations for billing practices at all foreign offices. The letter marked the first confirmation by the ministry of irregularities at the Paris embassy after French daily Le Monde reported that the embassy had set up an undeclared cash fund to pay staff for special events at the embassy for third parties. In the letter, first reported by the Koelner Stadt-Anzeiger newspaper, Lindner said the ministry had revamped billing procedures in Paris in spring 2016 after discovering that the previous form of billing had not met the usual standards. The changes were triggered after a former butler and head waiter accused the embassy of using fake invoices to channel money into a fund used to give staff undeclared cash for overtime work at events hosted on behalf of private companies such as BMW and Mercedes. Lindner said the changes implemented in Paris ensured a transparent accounting of the use of the embassy by third parties, but the thorough review now under way could also trigger recommendations for all foreign missions and embassies. Brantner urged the ministry to hold those accountable for the problematic billing practices in Paris - some of whom still worked for the ministry. In addition, all foreign offices must be carefully examined to ensure that such practices are not occurring elsewhere, Brantner said in a statement. She also called for protection of whistleblowers.",1,fakenewsnet,,Germany probes expenses at Paris embassy; no other embassies affected

"Does anyone else see the lunacy in this? You have a broke state that s trying to build a massive bullet train system and is over budget only in America s big government system where the goofballs think money grows on trees Is anyone else 100% FED Up! with this bullish*t? I know I am! The monumental task of building California s bullet train will require punching 36 miles of tunnels through the geologically complex mountains north of Los Angeles.Crews will have to cross the tectonic boundary that separates the North American and Pacific plates, boring through a jumble of fractured rock formations and a maze of earthquake faults, some of which are not mapped.It will be the most ambitious tunneling project in the nation s history.State officials say the tunnels will be finished by 2022 along with 300 miles of track, dozens of bridges or viaducts, high-voltage electrical systems, a maintenance plant and as many as six stations. Doing so will meet a commitment to begin carrying passengers between Burbank and Merced in the first phase of the $68-billion high-speed rail link between Los Angeles and San Francisco.However, a Times analysis of project documents, as well as interviews with scientists, engineers and construction experts, indicates that the deadline and budget targets will almost certainly be missed and that the state has underestimated the challenges ahead, particularly completing the tunneling on time. It doesn t strike me as realistic, said James Monsees, one of the world s top tunneling experts and an author of the federal manual on highway tunneling. Faults are notorious for causing trouble. The California High-Speed Rail Authority hasn t yet chosen an exact route through the mountains. It also is behind schedule on land acquisition, financing and permit approvals, among other crucial tasks, and is facing multiple lawsuits. The first construction began in Fresno in July, 21/2 years behind the target the rail authority had set in early 2012.A confidential 2013 report by the state s main project management contractor, New York-based Parsons Brinckerhoff, estimated that the cost of building the first phase from Burbank to Merced had risen 31% to $40 billion. And it projected that the cost of the entire project would rise at least 5%.Parsons Brinckerhoff briefed state officials on the estimate in October 2013, according to the document obtained by The Times. But the state used a lower cost estimate when it issued its 2014 business plan four months later.Jeff Morales, the rail authority chief executive, said he was not aware of the Parsons Brinckerhoff projection. A spokeswoman for the authority declined to discuss the differences in the estimates.Public opinion polls taken over the years have shown that support for the project has ebbed as costs have risen and at $68 billion, the budget is already more than double the $33-billion estimate made by the rail authority before California voters approved bonds for the project seven years ago.Via: LA Times",0,fakenewsnet,,Outrageous!

"EDINBURGH/LONDON (Reuters) - Scotland, Wales and London should all benefit from any special deal given to Northern Ireland to smooth access to European Union markets after Brexit, the three regions most senior politicians said on Monday. Most Scots and Londoners voted to stay in the EU in June 2016 s referendum, unlike their compatriots in the rest of the United Kingdom. Politicians in Scotland, Wales and the British capital have campaigned for Britain as a whole to stay in the EU s single market to smooth trade relations. Prime Minister Theresa May has ruled that out so far, saying Britain needed the freedom to make its own rules and trade deals. But the three regions rallied to the cause again after Irish government sources said on Monday that the British government had agreed to maintain EU regulatory alignment for Northern Ireland, which is part of the UK but shares a land border with the Republic of Ireland, an EU member state. May said there had been no overall agreement on Monday. Keeping regulations in Northern Ireland similar to those in the rest of the EU make it less likely that the bloc would insist on border checks after Brexit. But making an exception of Northern Ireland could make it difficult for May to argue that others cannot have the same. So far, she has argued that Brexit should follow a one-size-fits-all pattern for the whole of the United Kingdom. If one part of the United Kingdom can retain regulatory alignment with the European Union and effectively stay in the single market ... there is surely no good practical reason why others can t, Nicola Sturgeon, the head of Scotland s devolved pro-independence government, said on Twitter. Sturgeon welcomed the outline of a deal that meant no return to a hard border in Ireland, but argued that such an agreement meant something similar for Scotland was even more vital. For Scotland to find itself outside the single market, while Northern Ireland effectively stays in would place us at a double disadvantage when it comes to jobs and investment. A large majority of voters in Scotland, one of the UK s four nations with around 5 million people, voted to stay in the EU, as did Northern Ireland. Wales and England, the most populous nation, voted to leave, straining the structure of the UK and complicating negotiations to unwind four decades of political and trading links with the EU. Huge ramifications for London if Theresa May has conceded that it s possible for part of the UK to remain within the single market and customs union after Brexit, Sadiq Khan, London s mayor, said on Twitter. Britain s capital, with a population of 8.8 million, voted by a margin of 59.9 percent to remain within the EU. Turnout was high by local standards at nearly 70 percent and Khan, from Britain s main opposition Labour Party, campaigned to stay in the EU. Welsh first minister Carwyn Jones called for Wales to be allowed to continue to participate in the single market if other parts of the UK could. May s government has up to now ruled out any special deal for Scotland, although the Scottish government published a year ago a plan for the northernmost part of the UK to remain in the single market even if Britain as a whole leaves. Its plan was, however, rejected as unworkable by the UK government.",1,fakenewsnet,,"Scotland, Wales and London want special Brexit deal if Northern Ireland gets one"

"(Reuters) - On Friday, a cruise ship carrying around 3,000 passengers will dock at St. John s harbor in the Caribbean island of Antigua. It will not be where the passengers expected to land when they booked, however. The Carnival Plc ship was meant to dock in Saint Martin, 100 miles (160 km) to the northwest. However, Hurricane Irma devastated the island, wrecking its port and infrastructure, and leaving it out of bounds for tourists. Antiguan officials now expect the Carnival Fascination to visit every Friday, and have gotten about 25 calls from major cruise lines such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd and Norwegian Cruise Lines looking to make stops through the end of the year. For Asot Michael, Antigua and Barbuda s minister for tourism, the unexpected arrival of thousands of tourists is a bittersweet bonus. We are going to be benefiting. I don t want to benefit from others misfortune after such a disaster, Michael said. But because the port is so damaged in Saint Martin, so damaged in Tortola in the British Virgin Islands, we re getting some of those cancellations. Those cruise lines now are making ports of call into Antigua. Hurricane Irma left behind a stark divide in the Caribbean ahead of the winter tourism season that is the region s economic lifeblood. As travel to the region picks up again, cruise lines, hotels, airlines and other companies are directing customers to places that are able to host them, and away from the worst-hit areas. Popular winter vacation spots such as Saint Martin, the British Virgin Islands and Saint Barthelemy that were devastated by the storm could be sidelined for weeks or months. In 2016, 29.3 million tourists visited the Caribbean and spent $35.5 billion, both new records, according to the Caribbean Tourism Organization. For Saint Martin and Saint Bart, the holiday season looks very compromised, said Jean-Pierre Mas, chairman of French travel agency federation SNAV. My sentiment is that the winter season is lost. Decisions to book for the winter season are taken right now. Busy tourist destinations in the western Caribbean, such as Barbados and Trinidad, were well away from the path of the storm. Cozumel, on Mexico s Gulf Coast, got four additional visits this week as ships were rerouted to avoid the storm s impact, although Cozumel tourism officials said three cruises were canceled. Florida, which was anticipating another record year for its $100 billion a year tourism industry, is expected to rebound in time for the peak winter travel months, Moody s Analytics said earlier this week. Walt Disney Co reopened its Orlando Disney World theme park on Sept. 12. The Florida Keys, however, wrestled with more severe storm damage. [nL2N1LR0N1] [nF9N1L0029] [nL2N1LS1HW] Some travel companies said they are still assessing the situation and had not made firm decisions about rerouting ships. Tour operator Virgin Holidays said that it was beginning to return to regular operations in Antigua, despite damage to some properties on the island. Antigua wasn t as badly damaged as we feared, and we have reopened tourism there, although three resorts are currently not on sale because of the damage, a spokesman for Virgin Atlantic said. Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago, St. Lucia are three big tourist examples that were not impacted. However, the small island of Saint Martin, which France shares with the Netherlands, could miss out on much of its tourism season. French President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday vowed to swiftly rebuild the islands of the French Caribbean, including Saint Martin, and a French public reinsurance body estimated a cost of at least 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 billion) from the damage there and in Saint Barthelemy. [nL2N1LT1SF] [nL5N1LQ09G] Hurricane Irma badly damaged many hotels on the island, such as AccorHotels Mercure hotel. A spokeswoman for Accor said that while nobody had been hurt, the hotel would be closed until Jan. 8 at least. While 70 hotel rooms remain operational, they are being used to house military forces and other staff that are supporting the relief effort.

"PRETORIA (Reuters) - South African President Jacob Zuma has asked the High Court to reject a call by an anti-corruption watchdog for an official inquiry into alleged influence-peddling in his government. A report a year ago by South Africa s anti-graft agency known as Public Protector recommended a judicial probe be held to look into allegations of systemic corruption by Zuma, some of his ministers and heads of state-owned companies. The report focused on allegations that Zuma s friends, businessman brothers Ajay, Atul and Rajesh Gupta, had influenced the appointment of ministers. The 75-year-old Zuma, whose rule has long been dogged by scandal, and the Gupta brothers have denied the accusations. The president, who previously described the State of Capture report as unfair in parliament, wants the court to send it back to the watchdog for further investigations. He questioned the right of the report s author, Public Protector former head Thuli Madonsela, to call for a judicial inquiry. The report, whose public release Zuma had sought to block through the courts, called for an inquiry be set up by the president and for a judge to be appointed within 30 days of its release. Is she competent to then direct the president to hold a commission on inquiry? With respect to this submission, she s not, Zuma s lawyer Ishmael Semenya told the court, referring to Madonsela. The hearing is expected to continue until Thursday and a ruling is expected at a later date. Zuma this year faced a series of corruption allegations, most recently over leaked emails that suggest the Gupta brothers may have used their influence to secure state contracts for their companies. Zuma and the Gupta brothers have denied these allegations. Separately, Zuma is facing the possibility of more court charges. The Supreme Court this month upheld a High Court ruling to reinstate 783 corruption charges filed against him before he became president in 2009. The National Prosecuting Authority is expected to make a decision on whether to charge Zuma.",1,fakenewsnet,,South Africa's Zuma asks court to reject call for inquiry into influence-peddling

Several key Romney confidantes did not respond to requests for comment for this article, funneling requests to one source close to Romney who said in an email that Romney is not now engaged in an effort to recruit a third-party candidate. And while Romney remains motivated to help the stop Trump cause, a person involved in the stop-Trump discussions said that Romney is not calling or emailing any of the people who are still considering a run. A few potential candidates remain, the source said, although none at the moment are live prospects. Apparently, Romney gave up on his efforts to recruit a GOPer to run against the presumptive Republican nominee when prospective candidates like Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse said no. Although the #NeverTrump movement is still a thing, fewer right-wingers are speaking out against him. It is entirely possible that Trump s threats against people who were against him are working. Last week one of his campaign officials threatened to blacklist vendors and supporters of the anti-loudmouth billionaire movement.Mitt Romney entered the presidential primary earlier this year by blasting Donald Trump. Some people within the party looked at him like he was a superhero. Here was the 2012 Republican nominee trying to save the party, All hail, Mitt Romney! Trump, on the other hand, swatted Romney s attacks away like he was a little, annoying gnat. It was actually interesting to watch as a Democrat. How was the guy who the GOP settled for in 2012, really going to save the day?Well, he didn t and now he has failed again. He wasn t able to beat Trump anymore than he was able to beat Obama.Poor Mittens.Featured image Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",0,fakenewsnet,, Mitt Romney’s Effort To Stop Trump Ends Just Like His 2012 Bid For The White House Did

"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Swedish journalist Kim Wall died when she was accidentally hit by a heavy hatch cover on board a home-made submarine, the Danish owner of the vessel testified in court on Tuesday. Peter Madsen, who denies killing Wall, said he was holding the hatch for her but it slipped and hit her head as they sailed in the strait between Denmark and Sweden last month on the UC3 Nautilus submarine he had built. Madsen, 46, was speaking in court after being charged with killing the Swedish journalist on the submarine and mutilating her body a case bearing many of the attributes of the region s popular Nordic Noir books and films. It could mean a sentence of five years to life in prison for Madsen, if found guilty. The court on Tuesday ordered a psychiatric evaluation and that Madsen be kept in custody for four weeks. In its preliminary investigation, the court had ordered Madsen detained until Tuesday on the lesser charge of involuntary manslaughter. Madsen said Wall s death was an accident. With the vessel at the surface, he said he had crawled out through the hatch and was standing on top, while holding it open to let Wall follow him. At that moment, the submarine was rocked by a wave from another boat. I lose my foothold and the hatch shuts, he told the Copenhagen court, saying Wall was knocked to the floor. There was a pool of blood where she had landed. A prosecutor also read earlier testimony from behind closed doors in which Madsen said the impact had fractured the journalist s skull and killed her. Madsen said he tried to bury her at sea but denied mutilating her body, and added that he had contemplated killing himself while still on board. Wall, a 30-year-old freelance journalist who was researching a story on Madsen, went missing after he took her out to sea in his 17-metre (56-foot) submarine on Aug. 10. On Aug. 23, police identified a headless female torso that washed ashore in Copenhagen as Wall s. The cause of her death has not been determined. In court, Madsen denied having amputated her limbs and said he dropped her whole body into the water, several hours after her death, after having a sleep because he was tired and exhausted . He admitted that he wanted to bury her at sea by attaching metal to the body in order for it to sink. I had no contact with the body and didn t want a dead body in my submarine, Madsen told the court. I put a rope around her feet to drag her out of the hatch, he said, adding that he was crying during this operation. I am suicidal at this stage (and) thought a fitting end for Peter Madsen would be on board the Nautilus, he said. I was in a condition where I decided I couldn t continue the life I had been living. He changed his mind, he said, because he wanted to see his wife and three cats. The submarine is one of three Madsen had built and one of the largest privately built ones in the world. It could carry eight people and weighed 40 tonnes fully equipped. A day after taking Wall out to sea, Madsen was rescued in a navy operation after deliberately sinking the vessel.",1,fakenewsnet,,'Suicidal' Danish submarine owner says journalist killed by hatch cover

"WASHINGTON/LYNCHBURG, Va. (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Saturday he will move quickly to nominate a new FBI director, after he sparked a political firestorm by firing the man investigating possible collusion between Russia and the Trump presidential campaign. Trump told reporters he might even be able to make his decision on who should succeed James Comey to lead the Federal Bureau of Investigation before he leaves on his first foreign trip on Friday. “Even that is possible,” Trump said, speaking on Air Force One before departing for Lynchburg, Virginia, where he delivered a commencement address. “I think the process is going to go quickly,” he said, adding that the candidates under consideration were mostly well known. “They’ve been vetted over their lifetime essentially. But very well known, highly respected, really talented people. And that’s what we want for the FBI.” Critics have assailed Trump for abruptly dismissing Comey, who was leading the agency’s investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, and possible ties between Moscow and the Trump campaign.. Russia denies the claims and the White House says there was no collusion. Trump made the remarks to reporters prior to speaking to about 50,000 people at Liberty University in Lynchburg, where he did not mention Comey or the controversy his dismissal on Tuesday caused. It was Trump’s first public event outside the White House since Comey’s ouster. A White House official had said 11 people were under consideration - including acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, Republican Senator John Cornyn, New York Appeals Court Judge Michael Garcia and former Assistant Attorney General Alice Fisher - to replace Comey as FBI chief. Two new names, however, emerged on Saturday: FBI special agent Adam Lee and U.S. District Judge Henry Hudson. A source familiar with the process said Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his deputy, Rod Rosenstein, had interviewed Hudson, Lee and five others on Saturday. The FBI Agents Association, which claims more than 13,000 active and retired agents as its members, on Saturday endorsed another candidate: former Representative Mike Rogers, who had also worked as an FBI agent. At Liberty, the nation’s largest Christian college, Trump peppered his remarks with the kind of anti-establishment rhetoric that fueled his maverick presidential campaign, telling graduates to challenge “entrenched interests.” He thanked the crowd for their support and repeatedly invoked his own unlikely election victory. “Relish the opportunity to be an outsider,” Trump said. “The more that a broken system tells you that you’re wrong, the more certain you should be that you must keep pushing ahead.” He also had strong words that seemed aimed at his critics. “No one has ever achieved anything significant without a chorus of critics standing on the sidelines explaining why it can’t be done,” Trump said. “Nothing is easier or more pathetic than being a critic, because they’re people that can’t get the job done.” Liberty’s president, Jerry Falwell, Jr., was a key early supporter of Trump during his campaign and helped rally support among religious conservatives. Trump, who has been preparing for his first foreign trip - one that will take him to the Middle East and Europe - also will deliver the commencement address to the United States Coast Guard Academy in New London, Connecticut, on Wednesday.",1,fakenewsnet,,Trump pledges to move quickly to name new FBI director

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s budget proposal, set to be unveiled on Tuesday, will include cuts to Medicaid and propose changes to other assistance programs for low-income citizens, the Washington Post reported on Sunday. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A Republican healthcare bill that passed the U.S. House of Representatives in early May seeks to overhaul the national healthcare system and cut more than $800 billion over the next 10 years from Medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor and disabled. The healthcare bill faces a difficult time in the Senate, where Democrats and some Republicans worry about its impact on costs for low-income Americans, among other issues. “In yet another broken promise to working people, President Trump’s budget pulls the rug out from so many who need help,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement, in response to the report. “This budget is taking the fast lane to rejection by the American people and both parties in Congress” The Post report said the White House would also give individual U.S. states more autonomy over a variety of anti-poverty poverty programs including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, the largest U.S. anti-hunger program, which was formerly called the food stamp program. More than 44 million Americans received benefits from the SNAP program in February, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",1,fakenewsnet,,Medicaid cuts coming in Trump budget: Washington Post

Jamie Raskin is urging his colleagues to get behind a bill that could potentially oust the President if he was mentally or physically unfit.The Maryland Democrat wants to create an 11-member commission made up of mostly physicians and psychiatrists more formally called the Oversight Commission on Presidential Capacity. The panel would carry out a medical examination and determine whether the President was physically or mentally able to do the job. Two of the commission s members would also be former high ranking officials, such as presidents, vice presidents, attorneys general or secretaries of state. It s a provocative and long-shot effort, but Raskin is citing as his legal backup the 25th Amendment of the Constitution, which was adopted in 1967 after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy to establish procedure in the case a president is incapacitated. About two dozen Democrats have signed on to the effort as of Thursday. Raskin is zeroing in on one section of that constitutional amendment, which allows the vice president to assume powers if either the majority of the Cabinet or such other body as Congress finds that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of office.

"BERLIN (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron s proposals to strengthen the European Union drew mixed reaction in Germany, with a lawmaker from Chancellor Angela Merkel s Bavarian allies warning against turning the bloc into an unlimited transfer union . Macron offered a sweeping vision for a renewal of Europe in a speech on Tuesday, calling for the EU to cooperate more closely on defense, immigration, tax and social policy, and for the single currency bloc to have its own budget. He was speaking two days after the German election in which Merkel s conservative CDU/CSU bloc scored its worst result since 1949, limiting her freedom to maneuver on Europe. The co-governing Social Democrats (SPD), which suffered its worst election result since the end of World War Two, ruled out a re-run of a grand coalition with Merkel. Outgoing Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, a senior SPD member, lauded the French proposals. Emmanuel Macron today held a courageous, a passionate plea against nationalism and for Europe - a Europe which he wants to reform, strengthen and unite with our help, Gabriel said. Right now, we need to seize this opportunity for Franco-German initiatives to make Europe more democratic, involve the citizens and make it fit for the future. Gabriel said a joint determination by EU member states was needed to resolve problems in Europe, adding of Macron: He can count on us. Cem Ozdemir, co-leader of the left-leaning Greens, a potential coalition partner for Merkel, told reporters in Berlin: Germany should take Macron s extended hand and push Europe forward, with other partners. It s an important signal to us in Berlin that Macron makes his proposals directly after the German election. Because only if Paris and Berlin work closely together and have the courage to implement concrete reforms, can we strengthen Europe. Ozdemir, seen as a possible foreign or finance minister in Merkel s coalition government, said the euro zone in particular needed reforms to make it resilient against future shocks. We need investment in digitization, sustainable technologies and infrastructure, in particular, to ensure long-term investment and create future-proof jobs, Ozdemir said. But Hans Michelbach, a lawmaker from Merkel s CSU allies, said Macron s ideas were unsuitable to take Europe forward. They do not lead to a deepening (of the EU) but to a deeper split in the EU, he said. Michelbach accused Macron of planning to turn the euro zone into an unlimited transfer union and to roll back the EU s Stability Pact. But these are the wrong lessons from the euro zone crisis, Michelbach said, adding Macron should not be relieved of his duty to bring the French budget deficit in line with the EU s fiscal rules. His comments were echoed by Alexander Graf Lambsdorff, a senior member of the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP), another potential coalition partner for Merkel. This was a courageous speech by President Macron, even if not all of his proposals meet approval of the FDP, Lambsdorff said. Lambsdorff welcomed Macron s call to strengthen military cooperation in the EU and seize the opportunities of digitization, but he rejected the call for a euro zone budget. The problem in Europe is not a lack of public funds, but the lack of reform. A euro zone budget would set exactly the wrong incentives, Lambsdorff said. The fiscally conservative FDP dislikes the idea of any facility that may lead to financial transfers from wealthier euro zone countries to poorer ones. Macron said he hoped his ideas would be taken into account in Germany s coalition building negotiations. Those talks are not expected to begin until mid-October and may take several months.",1,fakenewsnet,,Macron's Europe speech draws mixed reaction in Berlin

"In the most surreal moment in modern American politics, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told panicking Republicans that the GOP would actively destroy Donald Trump s election chances if it came to that. That rush of warm air you feel on your face? It s the wave of radiation from the Republican Party s nuclear meltdown. We re witnessing the death of a major political party.Things are getting truly desperate in conservative camps and the grim acceptance that this isn t a bad dream and that Trump is almost surely going to win the nomination has begun to set in. It s led to an odd plan. In a stunning report by the New York Times, Republican sources confirm that party leadership is planning to destroy Trump and give Hillary Clinton the win rather than let him have control of the GOP.To rally depressed Republicans, McConnell has hatched an unthinkable tactical retreat: Let Hillary Clinton win and focus on maintaining control over the Senate.While still hopeful that Mr. Rubio might prevail, Mr. McConnell has begun preparing senators for the prospect of a Trump nomination, assuring them that, if it threatened to harm them in the general election, they could run negative ads about Mr. Trump to create space between him and Republican senators seeking re-election. Mr. McConnell has raised the possibility of treating Mr. Trump s loss as a given and describing a Republican Senate to voters as a necessary check on a President Hillary Clinton, according to senators at the lunches.Did you catch that? Mitch McConnell floated the idea of tanking his party s own candidate for president over sandwiches at lunch.McConnell s thinking is this: If Republicans accept that Trump will never win the general election, they can devote their energy towards running against Clinton at the senate level. If that sounds insane, then welcome to the Republican Party in 2016.The saddest part in this scheme is that McConnell s plan probably won t even work at least not in the way he hopes. For one thing, Trump has run his entire campaign on being anti-everything the current establishment Republican Party stands for. If his rabid supporters catch wind of the fact that loathed senators like Mitch McConnell are lining against him, that will only make him more popular. Trump s been saying the party is against him all along. This only confirms it.Making matters even more dire, McConnell s tenure as Senate Leader has been defined by such egregious levels of obstructionism that Republican lawmakers are roughly as popular as athlete s foot. In just the last few weeks, sources leaked McConnell s plan to literally do nothing during this year s legislative session. If that do nothing strategy is shameful, he only made it worse by following it up with the announcement that he would be blocking President Obama s Supreme Court Justice nominee to score political points. Neither decision was popular with Democrats or Republicans.As a result, polls suggest McConnell is leading Senate Republicans into an epic defeat on election day. Having destroyed Trump to save the jobs of Senate Republicans, he will be left with nothing to show for it. A fitting end to a Republican Party that rushed so fast to the bottom that they didn t realize they had jumped off of a cliff.Featured image via Gage Skidmore/Flickr",0,fakenewsnet,, Panicking Mitch McConnell Says GOP Will Help Hillary Beat Trump If He Wins The Nomination

"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Zimbabwe s longstanding government and ruling party mouthpiece, The Herald newspaper, has abruptly changed its tune on President Robert Mugabe s wife Grace, confirmation of her political downfall. The Herald often takes its marching orders from the information ministry. And it has always reported from the point of view of the winning faction in the ruling ZANU-PF, making it a reliable barometer of someone s political standing. In August, the paper ran a typically fawning portrait of Grace under the headline A Loving Mother of the Nation. Loving mother, compassionate philanthropist, astute businesswoman, perceptive politician, remarkable patriot, these are all adjectives that can be used to describe the First Lady Dr Grace Mugabe, The Herald gushed. Less than three months later and in the wake of a coup that threatens Mugabe s presidency and has seen both he and Grace expelled from ZANU-PF, her Herald portrayal was starkly different. Grace Mugabe lacked grooming and true motherhood as shown by her foul language, the paper quoted the ZANU-PF s youth wing as saying. We take exception to the vulgar language which had become part of Mrs Mugabe s vocabulary, it quoted a Youth League cadre as saying. Zimbabweans, many of whom are devoutly religious and culturally conservative, often take offense at profanities. The piece featured an unflattering picture of an unsmiling Grace - a sharp departure from the loving mother portrayal that included photos of her smiling and holding infants. Until the events of the past week, the political fortunes of Grace dubbed Gucci Grace for her reputed fondness shopping sprees were on the rise, if The Herald s coverage was anything to go on. In September 2014, the University of Zimbabwe awarded her a PHD raising eyebrows as her academic prowess had previously been unknown. But in Zimbabwe, the path to power is paved with academic letters. Weeks later, one Herald headline blared: Dr Grace Mugabe honored in song. At the time, she was being shoe-horned into the top position in ZANU-PF s Women s League, and the song was entitled: Dr G Mugabe For Women s League Secretary. Just 12 days ago, paper was reporting that the Women s League was backing Grace in her bid to become vice president. This was days after Mugabe sacked his deputy Emmerson Mnangagwa, clearing the path for Grace to assume the role and succeed her 93-year-old husband. It was this tilt at power that triggered the army backlash.",1,fakenewsnet,,Zimbabwe's state mouthpiece captures fall of First Lady Grace

"NATIONAL HARBOR, Md./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said he would make a massive budget request for one of the “greatest military buildups in American history” on Friday in a feisty, campaign-style speech extolling robust nationalism to eager conservative activists. Trump used remarks to the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), an organization that gave him one of his first platforms in his improbable journey to the U.S. presidency, to defend his unabashed “America first” policies. Ahead of a nationally televised speech to Congress on Tuesday, Trump outlined plans for strengthening the U.S. military, already the world’s most powerful fighting force, and other initiatives such as tax reform and regulatory rollback. He offered few specifics on any initiatives, including the budget request that is likely to face a harsh reality on Capitol Hill: At a time when he wants to slash taxes for Americans, funding a major military buildup without spending cuts elsewhere would add substantially to the U.S. budget deficit. Trump said he would aim to upgrade the military in both offensive and defensive capabilities, with a massive spending request to Congress that would make the country’s defense “bigger and better and stronger than ever before.” “And, hopefully, we’ll never have to use it, but nobody is going to mess with us. Nobody. It will be one of the greatest military buildups in American history,” Trump said. Appealing to people on welfare to go to work and pledging to follow through on his vow to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border, Trump drew rounds of applause from the large gathering of conservatives, many of them wearing hats emblazoned with the president’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.” His speech was heavy on the nationalist overtones from his campaign last year, focusing on promises to boost U.S. economic growth by retooling international trade deals, cracking down on immigration and boosting energy production. Trump is looking to put behind him a rocky first month in office. An executive order he signed aimed at banning U.S. entry by people from seven Muslim-majority countries became embroiled in the courts and he had to fire his national security adviser, Michael Flynn, for Russian contacts before Trump took office. With the federal budget still running a large deficit, Trump will have to fight to get higher military spending through Congress. In his speech, he complained about spending caps put in place on the defense budget dating back to 2011. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Trump’s proposed budget for this year “will be very clear” on how to fund the military spending increase. Trump also heaped criticism on what he called purveyors of “fake news,” seeking to clarify a recent tweet in which he said some in the U.S. news media should be considered an “enemy of the people.” He said his main beef was the media’s use of anonymous sources. “They shouldn’t be allowed to use sources unless they use somebody’s name. Let their name be out there,” Trump said. His comments came on the same day CNN reported that White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus asked FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe to deny a Feb. 14 report in the New York Times that said Trump’s presidential campaign advisers had been in frequent contact with Russian intelligence officers. The request came after McCabe told him privately the report was wrong. A senior administration official said on Friday that FBI Director James Comey told Priebus later that the story was not accurate. Priebus asked if the Federal Bureau of Investigation could set the record straight, but Comey said the bureau could not comment, the official said. Trump has repeatedly chosen to make news media criticism a focus of his public remarks since taking office on Jan. 20. The speech allowed Trump to put his stamp firmly on the conservative political movement, even as some activists fretted that his immigration and trade policies go too far. With Trump in the White House and Republicans holding majorities in both houses of Congress, CPAC and the thousands of conservative activists who flock to the event each year from across the country are seeing their political influence rising.",1,fakenewsnet,,"Trump vows military build-up, hammers nationalist themes"

She was 89. Dupree arrived in Kabul in 1962 as a diplomat s wife but soon divorced and married Louis Dupree, an archaeologist celebrated for his adventurous exploits and groundbreaking discoveries of Paleolithic Afghan tools and artifacts. For the next 15 years, they traveled across Afghanistan by Land Rover as Louis Dupree excavated prehistoric sites and Nancy wrote a series of witty and insightful guidebooks to a country since torn apart by decades of warfare. She called herself an old monument and a lot of Afghans called her the Grandmother of Afghanistan, said Wahid Wafa, Executive Director of the Afghanistan Centre. She understood and knew Afghanistan much better than anybody else. A fixture in the social scene of Kabul during the 1970s, a now-vanished world of smart cocktail parties and mini-dresses, they were forced to leave in 1978 after the Soviet-backed government accused Louis Dupree of being a spy. Her husband died in 1989 and much of the time before her return to Afghanistan in 2005 was spent in Pakistan, where as well as briefly meeting Osama Bin Laden and working with the growing number of war refugees, she assiduously gathered as much documentation on Afghanistan as she could. In 2005, after the fall of the Taliban and the installation of a new Western-backed government in Kabul, she returned with some 35,000 documents wrapped up in fertilizer bags, which became the basis for the Afghanistan Centre archive. A prolific writer, she was director of the Centre between 2006 and 2011 and continued to go into her office after she stepped down, remaining an institution in the cultural life of Kabul and receiving a stream of visitors. It was Nancy s aim to preserve Afghanistan s heritage, said Wafa. She was a very funny, interesting person who loved to talk to anyone coming to visit. She was kind, she was very giving with the information she had and she was always lobbying for the Afghanistan she first knew. While she could be waspishly critical of both blundering Westerners and Afghans she felt were promoting a bigoted version of their culture, she retained her faith in her adopted country to the end, Wafa said. Despite the 40 years of war in Afghanistan she was always hopeful of the future and hopeful for the future of the new generation in Afghanistan.",1,fakenewsnet,,Nancy Hatch Dupree 'Grandmother of Afghanistan' dies in Kabul

"(Reuters) - Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump drew guffaws and derision on social media after he asked a campaign rally in Pittsburgh, “How’s Joe Paterno?” The legendary Penn State University football coach died four years ago. “I went to school in this state. I know a lot about Pennsylvania and it’s great,” Trump said. “How’s Joe Paterno? We gonna bring that back? How about that whole deal?” The term ""Joe Paterno"" quickly became a top trending topic on Twitter, with many asking if Trump knew Paterno was dead. A video clip was posted on YouTube. Paterno, once one of the most revered college athletic coaches in the United States, was fired by Pennsylvania State University in 2011 over a child sexual abuse scandal involving assistant coach Jerry Sandusky. Paterno died on Jan. 21, 2012. Sandusky was later convicted on child sex abuse charges. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said the candidate was referring to a statue of Paterno that was removed from the campus in 2012. A Quinnipiac University survey in 2015 showed that many Pennsylvanians want it returned to the campus. Penn State spokesman Ben Manning said on Thursday the university does not comment on candidates’ campaign speeches. Social media users mocked Trump for seemingly implying that he would bring Paterno back to life. ""Someone should tell Trump that Joe Paterno is dead and also that he conspired with a serial child rapist,"" tweeted kept_simple BuzzFeed political editor Katherine Miller tweeted, ""Trump obviously meant when are we going to bring back the Paterno statue and then, subsequently, Paterno back from beyond, through sorcery."" Twitter users with accounts geo-tagged to the university’s home, the town of State College, had mixed reactions. ""Bring Paterno back? @realdonaldtrump has odd expectations of his abilities, and responsibilities, as president,"" tweeted Holly Swanson Not all reaction was negative. ""All Trump has to do is say he'll bring the Paterno statue back. He'll win PA in a landslide,"" Kalooz Trump had weighed in on the fallout from the Sandusky scandal in July 2012 when the National Collegiate Athletic Association levied sanctions against Penn State’s football program.

"WELLINGTON (Reuters) - A final tally in New Zealand s inconclusive election due to be released on Saturday could see opposition Labour and the Greens gain a few seats, but will still leave nationalist New Zealand First holding the balance of power. New Zealand First leader Winston Peters has said he will not make a decision on which party to back to form a coalition government until after the final count. Peters has held initial talks with Prime Minister Bill English and his ruling National Party and Labour leader Jacinda Ardern, but more formal talks will take place next week. Peters has said he will make a decision by Oct. 12. The National Party has won 58 seats in the 120-seat parliament, ahead of a possible coalition of 52 seats between Labour and the Greens. New Zealand First holds the balance of power with nine seats. Judging by past elections the National Party could lose one or two seats in the final tally, which will count special votes which make up 15 percent of ballots and include overseas votes, said Oliver Hartwich, executive director of think-tank New Zealand Initiative. Labour or the Greens or both of them are going to pick up the seats from National. It would be quite surprising if they didn t because ... the special votes usually favor the left, Hartwich said. Peters has in past elections formed coalition governments with both the National Party and Labour, and some analysts believe if Labour and the Greens gain more seats in the final tally it could make Peters more comfortable to again join them. Peters policies are thought to have more in common with those of Labour - both want to curb immigration, renegotiate certain trade deals and adjust the role of the central bank albeit in different ways. Nobody can really tell at the moment. He (Peters) has completely kept the cards (close) to his chest, nobody can read what he is going to do, Hartwich said. While National and the Greens have enough seats to form a coalition government, Green Party leader James Shaw played down recent speculation that they may enter talks. The Greens have a working agreement with Labour.",1,fakenewsnet,,Final tally in New Zealand's inconclusive election to be released

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former FBI Director James Comey accused President Donald Trump on Thursday of firing him to try to undermine the agency’s investigation of possible collusion by Trump’s campaign with Russia’s alleged efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election. In the most eagerly anticipated U.S. congressional hearing in years, Comey told lawmakers the Trump administration had lied and defamed him and the Federal Bureau of Investigation after the president dismissed him on May 9. During more than two hours of testimony, Comey told the Senate Intelligence Committee he believed Trump had directed him in February to drop an FBI probe into the Republican president’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, as part of the broader Russia investigation. Comey would not say whether he thought the president sought to obstruct justice, but added it would be up to special counsel Robert Mueller, who is now investigating the Russia allegations, “to sort that out.” “I don’t think it’s for me to say whether the conversation I had with the president was an effort to obstruct. I took it as a very disturbing thing, very concerning,” Comey testified. Sitting alone at a small table facing a bank of senators who fired question after question, Comey gave short, deliberative answers. He painted a picture of an overbearing president he did not trust and who pressured him to stop the FBI probe of Flynn. Trump critics say any efforts by the president to hinder an FBI probe could amount to obstruction of justice. Such an offense potentially could lead to Trump being impeached, although his fellow Republicans who control Congress have shown little appetite for such a move. In a speech to supporters across town, Trump vowed to fight on. “We’re under siege ... but we will come out bigger and better and stronger than ever,” he said. Comey did not make any major disclosures about any links between Trump or his associates and Russia, an issue that has dogged the president’s first months in office and distracted from his policy goals such as overhauling the U.S. healthcare system and making tax cuts. Russia has denied such interference. The White House has denied any collusion with Moscow. Nevertheless, the Russia matter likely will continue to overshadow Trump’s presidency, especially as the FBI probe has ensnared not only Flynn but Trump’s son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has had to recuse himself from the investigation. Comey’s testimony drew renewed attention to Sessions and his relationship with Russia’s ambassador to the United States, Sergei Kislyak. After Trump fired Comey, the administration gave differing reasons for his dismissal. Trump later contradicted his own staff and acknowledged on May 11 he fired Comey because of the Russia matter. Asked why he thought Trump fired him, Comey said he did not know for sure. He added: “Again, I take the president’s words. I know I was fired because of something about the way I was conducting the Russia investigation was in some way putting pressure on him, in some way irritating him, and he decided to fire me because of that.” Comey said repeatedly there were details he could not discuss in a public session, making clear he had sensitive information he could disclose only in a closed session with the senators. Comey said Trump’s administration had defamed him in comments made after his firing by saying the FBI was in disarray and that the workforce had lost confidence in its leader. “Those were lies, plain and simple,” Comey said. His accusations could further mire Trump’s administration in legal difficulties. Mueller and several congressional committees are investigating what U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded was an effort by Russia to help Trump win the election. “The Russian investigation is going to go on and it’s not going to stop and the president should have known that,” committee member Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein told MSNBC. Trump’s personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, said Comey’s testimony proved the president was not under any investigation and there was no evidence a single vote was changed as a result of Russian interference in last year’s election. Kasowitz denied Trump ever told Comey he needed and expected his loyalty, as Comey said. NBC News reported on Thursday that Kushner was expected to meet with staff members of the Senate Intelligence Committee in mid-June. Comey said he felt he needed to get his account of his conversations with Trump in the public sphere in the hope it might prompt the appointment of a special counsel, which later occurred. Comey said he gave copies of his memo memorializing his talks with Trump to people outside the Justice Department and asked a friend to share its contents with a journalist. Columbia Law School professor Daniel Richman confirmed to Reuters he was the friend to whom Comey was referring. Kasowitz said that “we will leave it to the appropriate authorities” to determine whether Comey’s leak “should be investigated.” Legal experts questioned Kasowitz’s contention that Trump’s private encounters with Comey should be considered privileged communications. Comey said he did not know if there were tapes of his conversations with Trump, but that if so, they should be released. “Lordy, I hope there are tapes,” Comey said. Republicans on the committee questioned Comey intently but did not attack his integrity or try to treat him roughly, as a witness making accusations against a sitting Republican president might expect. Comey testified he kept notes after meeting with Trump because “I was honestly concerned that he might lie about the nature of our meeting, and so I thought it really important to document.” From Capitol Hill to San Francisco’s Castro district, Comey’s appearance attracted television “watch parties” beckoning politics buffs to taverns, restaurants and living rooms to view an event some likened to the “Super Bowl of Washington.” U.S. stocks closed slightly higher as the market reacted little to Comey’s testimony, viewing his testimony alone as unlikely to mark the end of Trump’s presidency. Comey said Trump did not attempt to get him to drop the overall Russia investigation, just the part of if that related to Flynn, whom the president fired in February for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the extent of his conversations last year with Kislyak. Republican Senator Marco Rubio asked Comey whether he perceived the president’s request to let the Flynn matter go as an order given Trump’s position as president, the setting and the circumstances surrounding the conversation. “Yes,” Comey replied. Laura Donohue, a Georgetown University Law Center professor, said if Trump fired Comey to change the course of the Russia investigation, that would constitute obstruction of justice. Both the conversation between Trump and Comey about Flynn and the firing itself were obstructive acts, she said. “He wanted to scuttle the investigation - it is hard to see it any other way,” she said. Regarding Sessions, Comey said he did not discuss Trump’s pressure to drop the probe into Flynn with the attorney general because the FBI leadership team believed Sessions would later recuse himself from the Russia probe. “We were also aware of facts that I can’t discuss in an open setting that would make his continued engagement in a Russia-related investigation problematic,” Comey said, without giving more details. The Justice Department later issued a statement saying that Sessions recused himself from the Russia probe only because he had been part of Trump’s campaign. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said he did not believe Trump had committed a crime even if his personal style was often brash, adding: “I’ll just say it, if being crude, rude and a bull in a china shop was a crime, Trump would get the death penalty.”",1,fakenewsnet,,Comey says Trump fired him to undermine FBI Russia investigation

"American taxpayers are being charged more than $66,000 an hour for prayers said in the US House and Senate. The total cost per prayer, which lasts an average of 90 seconds, is a whopping $1,659.According to Andrew Seidel of the Freedom From Religion Foundation, who did the math to determine what taxpayers are being charged for prayers in Washington, the total annual bill comes to more than $800,000.Both the U.S. House and Senate employ a chaplain whose singular duty is to administer prayer. The budget for the House Chaplain s office is $345,000, while the Senate Chaplain s office receives $436,886.Seidel reports that both the House and Senate chaplains earn executive level salaries which are equal to those of high-ranking government officials, such as general counsels of the Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force; the chief financial officers of NASA and the EPA; the Chief Information Officers of almost every major federal department and agency; and the Army s Director of Civil Defense. The two chaplains earn three-figure salaries for presiding over opening prayers in the house and senate, which only convene about 135 days out of the year.Seidel reports:And even with those fat salaries, the official chaplains let guest chaplains deliver many of the prayers about 40% in the House. The House chaplains gave 1,341 invocations over the 16 years from 2000-2015, or about 84 invocations each year. Guest chaplains gave another 857 over that same span. Congress is budgeting more than three-quarters of a million dollars every year for chaplains to give these prayers or coordinate the guest chaplains prayers.As Seidel explains here, in 2011 the House Chaplain delivered just 104 prayers, lasting an average of 90 seconds each. That s about 2.6 hours of work. For that he was paid $172,500, or $66,346 an hour.Over the 15-year period between 2000 and 2015, US taxpayers spent $10 million on prayers in Washington. In the meantime, elected officials slashed spending on essential programs like WIC and SNAP as well as other assistance for the vulnerable.The idea that taxpayers are being billed exorbitant amounts of money for prayers, all while right-wing politicians screech about the national debt and wasteful government spending, is beyond outrageous.The church is not government and government is not a church. Everyone is free to exercise their religious beliefs in the U.S. Using millions of dollars in taxpayer money to support daily prayers in Washington, however, is not even close to acceptable.The Freedom From Religion Foundation is encouraging voters to make their voices heard on this issue by contacting their elected representatives here and here.Image credit: Wikipedia",0,fakenewsnet,," Taxpayers Billed $800,000 A Year For Prayers In Congress"
"COLUMBIA, S.C. (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton crushed rival Bernie Sanders at the South Carolina primary on Saturday, propelling her into next week’s crucial “Super Tuesday” voting in 11 states on a wave of momentum. The rout of Sanders solidified Clinton’s status as the strong front-runner to capture the party’s nomination for the Nov. 8 election in her quest to become America’s first woman president. With nearly half of the votes counted in South Carolina, Clinton led Sanders by a 50-point margin, dramatically reversing her 28-point loss in the state to President Barack Obama during their bitter 2008 primary battle. The former secretary of state’s victory decisively established her strength among black voters, a crucial Democratic constituency who make up more than half of the party’s primary electorate in South Carolina. After the win, Clinton appeared to be looking ahead to a general-election matchup with Republican front-runner Donald Trump, the billionaire whose campaign slogan is “Make America Great Again” and has called for building a wall on the border with Mexico. “Despite what you hear, we don’t need to make America great again, America has never stopped being great,” she told cheering supporters in Columbia after the win. “Instead of building walls, we need to be tearing down barriers.” The result was Clinton’s third victory in the first four Democratic contests, and raised more questions about whether Sanders, the democratic socialist U.S. senator from Vermont, will be able to expand his support beyond his base of predominantly white liberals. “Today you sent a message,” Clinton said. “In America, when we stand together, there is no barrier too big to break.” Sanders admitted defeat early in the night. “Let me be clear on one thing tonight. This campaign is just beginning. We won a decisive victory in New Hampshire. She won a decisive victory in South Carolina. Now it’s on to Super Tuesday,” Sanders said in a statement. The Democratic race now becomes a broader national contest. Eleven states, including six in the South with large minority populations where polls show Clinton with big leads, will vote on Super Tuesday and four more over the next weekend. “Tomorrow, this campaign goes national,” Clinton said. Clinton’s camp was hoping a big win in South Carolina, after more narrow victories in Iowa and Nevada and Sanders’ clear win in New Hampshire, will set her up for a big night on Tuesday, when about 875 delegates will be up for grabs, more than one-third of those needed to win the nomination. Sanders, who has energized the party’s liberal wing and brought young people to the polls with his message of attacking income equality and reining in Wall Street, needs a breakthrough win in a key state in the next few weeks to keep his hopes alive. “The door is closing fast for Bernie Sanders,” unaligned Democratic strategist Chris Kofinis said. “Movement candidates are about momentum and excitement, and losses sap that momentum. That’s his problem right now.” Recognizing his steep odds in South Carolina, Sanders had spent most of the past week in states that will vote in March. As the results rolled in on Saturday, he was scheduled to hold a rally in the “Super Tuesday” state of Minnesota.

"Donald Trump claims to have a huge penis, but he apparently doesn t have the balls to handle tough questions about his racism.When NPR s Cokie Roberts interviewed Trump on Wednesday morning, she challenged his racism and how it is affecting children. Mr. Trump, there have been incidents of children, of white children, pointing to their darker-skinned classmates and saying, you ll be deported when Donald Trump is president. There have been incidents of white kids at basketball games holding up signs to teams that have Hispanics on them saying, we re going to build a wall to keep you out. Are you proud of that? Is that something that you ve done into the American and social discourse that you re proud of? The thin-skinned Trump had an immediate problem with the question, calling it nasty and claiming that he has never heard of such instances before now. Well I think your question s a very nasty question and I m not proud of it because I didn t even hear of it, Trump replied. And I certainly do not like it at all when I hear about it. Trump then proceeded to talk over Roberts as she attempted to press him on the fact that his campaign has been nastier than any question she has asked, pointing at his hostility towards Hispanics, Muslims, and even black people at his rallies.Roberts didn t back down though. As Trump bragged about the beautiful door his Mexican border wall will have, she asked him again to think of the children and give his response to the way kids are picking up his racism and using it against fellow students and schools: But what about the children, Mr. Trump? What about what the children are hearing from you and how they are responding to it? Trump responded by claiming that he thinks people are responding very positively, and repeated his slogan that he trying to Make America Great Again, to which Roberts quipped, unless you think American is great already.

"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - A former vice-chairman of China s securities regulator, Yao Gang, is being investigated for taking bribes, the official China Daily said, citing the prosecutors office. Yao was one of the most senior figures arrested in a crackdown on suspected stock manipulation in late 2015, after the mid-year collapse of the Chinese stock market following a long bull run. Yao was subject to coercive measures, which can range from summons and surveillance to detention and arrest, among other actions, the Supreme People s Procuratorate said, without specifying which he faced, the newspaper said on Thursday. In July, China s graft watchdog said Yao would be prosecuted for offences that included taking bribes and destroying the order of capital markets . Yao, 55, was the general manager of Guotai Junan Securities in 1999 before taking a position with the China Securities Regulatory Commission in 2002, the paper said.

"During an interview on ABC s This Week, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was questioned by the show s host, George Stephanopoulos, about Russia s involvement with Crimea. Trump s answer is so completely ignorant that it definitively proves that Trump has a childlike understanding of current foreign affairs.While being questioned about Vladamir Putin and the GOP s stance regarding Ukraine, Trump insisted that Putin is not moving into Crimea despite the fact that Putin had already moved into Crimea in 2014. He s not going into Ukraine, OK, just so you understand. He s not going to go into Ukraine, all right? You can mark it down. You can put it down. You can take it anywhere you want, Trump said. Well, he s already there, isn t he? Stephanopoulos responded.Trump said: OK well, he s there in a certain way. But I m not there. You have Obama there. And frankly, that whole part of the world is a mess under Obama with all the strength that you re talking about and all of the power of NATO and all of this. In the meantime, he s going away. He takes Crimea. Trump then seemed to imply that Russia had a greater claim to the Crimean than the Ukraine. I m going to take a look at it, Trump said. But you know, the people of Crimea, from what I ve heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were. And you have to look at that, also just so you understand, that was done under Obama s administration. Trump went on to say: And as far as the Ukraine is concerned, it s a mess. And that s under the Obama s administration with his strong ties to NATO. So with all of these strong ties to NATO, Ukraine is a mess. Crimea has been taken. Don t blame Donald Trump for that. Trump, at no point during the line of questioning Stephanopoulos gave him regarding the Ukraine, seemed to know what he was talking about. He appears to have no knowledge of one of the biggest events to happen so far in the 21st century.You can watch the relevant part of the interview to @ThisWeekABC: Putin's ""not gonna go into Ukraine, all right?

"QUEBRADILLAS, Puerto Rico (Reuters) - When Nestor Rodriguez saw Puma Energy fuel tanker 333 pull into Puerto Rico s Quebradillas gas station at 12:37 p.m. on Monday, he bowed, raising his arms to the heavens. I didn t know if it would come today, or if wouldn t, he said as he filled up his tank, after a three-hour wait in the Caribbean sun. When I saw that truck, I saw the glory. It was like seeing the Lord. Two weeks after Hurricane Maria plowed into the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, cutting power and hobbling fuel distribution, finding gasoline and diesel has become a regular ordeal for the island s 3.4 million residents, with no guarantee of success. Rodriguez, a 63-year-old retiree with a bright shock of white hair and beard, was one of the lucky few on Monday. He managed to purchase enough gasoline for both his car and his generator at home, where he cares for his 93-year-old father. Fuel scarcity has been one of the major headaches facing hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico, which relies on gas shipped from the U.S. mainland. Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello on Monday reported progress in getting fuel supplies to the island, with 500,000 barrels of diesel and close to 1 million barrels of gasoline due to arrive in upcoming days. More than 720 of the island s 1,100 gas stations were now up and running, Rossello added, which he said should allow more Puerto Ricans to operate generators and get around. Puma Energy, which is partially owned by commodities trading giant Trafigura, operates six terminals on the Caribbean island, and is working with the regional government to add more delivery trucks to its fleet. To assess the scale of the problem, Reuters joined a Puma delivery truck and its 49-year-old driver, Carlos Ramos, on a journey from Puma s fuel distribution center in Bayamon, to a gas station in Quebradillas, some 55 miles (88 km) west. Ramos pulled out of the Bayamon facility at 10:38 a.m., escorted by two police vehicles responsible for protecting his precious 10,000-gallon (38,000 liter) load. Ramos said he had made more than 30 deliveries since Maria hit, and was often greeted with elation when he arrived at gas stations. At some, bands played to celebrate the truck s arrival, while at others, he felt like a politician arriving at a rally. If there s no line when we arrive, there will be soon, Ramos said. It s like putting out a little candy, and suddenly all the ants arrive. When Ramos eventually got to Quebradillas, nine cars were waiting. Within 10 minutes, the line had grown to 42 vehicles, with more arriving every few seconds. Luz Preciado, a 34-year-old housewife, said she had been waiting at a nearby station, when she saw Ramos truck drive by, and decided to give chase, despite the fact that her fuel gauge was blinking on empty. When you see water, and when you see gas - that s happiness in Puerto Rico right now, said Preciado, who had slept overnight in her car with her two kids a few days earlier to be first in line for a morning fuel delivery. Looking for gas is a full-time job right now. Inside the gas station, 44-year-old Puma employee Waldemar Sosa said he normally sold about 1,400 gallons during a typical 6 a.m.-10 p.m. day. On Sunday, he said, he sold 12,000 gallons - all the fuel he had - in about 13 hours. Sosa said that with no cellphone coverage to phone in orders, the owner of the gas station was forced to travel to San Juan to write Puma a check for more fuel. Without communication, this country doesn t move, he said. At 1:55 p.m., Juan Gonzalez rolled out of Sosa s station, the first person to leave with a full tank since 9 p.m. the previous evening, to go eat a simple of lunch of sausage and rice with his elderly parents. We re going through a difficult moment, he said, leaning out of his car window with a look of hard-won relief. We re in God s hands.",1,fakenewsnet,,Joy and relief greet Puerto Rico fuel deliveries after hurricane

"While many churches defend pastors who have raped or molested children in their congregations, a church in Pennsylvania is showing them what doing the right thing looks like.35-year-old youth pastor Wesley Ryan Blackburn is currently in jail waiting to be tried on 84 felony counts of statutory sexual assault, 84 misdemeanor counts of indecent assault and one felony count of corruption of minors, according to The Tribune-Democrat.Blackburn worked at Faith Brethren Bible Church in New Paris until last week when he admitted to his wife and state troopers that he impregnated a 15-year-old girl who was a member of the youth group he was teaching.The so-called man of God admitted his crimes to his wife after she confronted him about his misconduct. He then told her he didn t love her anymore and demanded a divorce.Blackburn s wife immediately called pastor James Espenshade and told him about her husband s misconduct with the teen girl.But unlike other churches that have stood by pastors who commit sex crimes, the Faith Brethren Bible Church did the right thing and straight up fired Blackburn and called the police. We didn t even care what he had to say, Espenshade told WAJC. We don t tolerate this kind of stuff it s inappropriate, it s reprehensible. There was never a discussion of anything else. We had to do what was right. Police questioned Blackburn while he was packing up his office and he was arrested and charged.The way this church handled Blackburn stands in sharp contrast to the way Columbia Road Baptist Church in North Olmsted, Ohio handled a similar situation.When youth pastor Brian Mitchell, a married man with three kids, was arrested and sentenced to ten years in prison for raping a teen girl, the church not only didn t fire him after discovering inappropriate texts he had been sending her, they continued to stand by him even after he went to prison by blaming the victim and demanding that she apologize to Mitchell s wife.Like Mitchell, Blackburn will probably receive a similar sentence. But Faith Brethren Bible Church deserves praise for calling the police upon learning of Blackburn s misconduct and for immediately terminating his employment. They also deserve praise for not blaming the teenage victim for Blackburn s actions. This is the way churches should handle these situations, but sadly, far too many of them do not.Featured image via Wikimedia",0,fakenewsnet,, Pennsylvania Church Demonstrates How To Deal With A Child-Molesting Pastor
"During President Obama s final National Security speech as president, he took a moment to let President-Elect Trump know that it s imperative citizens are able to criticize authority without fearing they ll get in trouble.It was clearly a remark aimed at Trump because of the president-elect s inability to be able to take criticism and will often lash out in some way shape or form against whoever dare to speak up against him or have a different opinion.President Obama said: freedom can never be taken for granted. Each of us has a responsibility to sustain it. The universal right to speak your mind protest against authority. To live in a society that s open and free. That can criticize a president without retribution. If Trump actually wants to be president, he s going to have to learn how to handle criticism, and he s going to have to learn fast. He s not only going to get criticized by both sides of the aisle, but by the public at large and the rest of the world. He needs to be able to handle that and not do anything to threaten our national security nor the freedom of American citizens to speak their mind.President Obama has been one of our most criticized national leaders in a long time, and he, more than most, knows that you must keep a level head, and he clearly wants Trump to learn how to do that too.Watch President Obama throw major shade at Trump here:Obama says the US is a country where citizens have a right to protest against authority and criticize a president without retribution pic.twitter.com/8XQAw0BdAt Brianna Sacks December 6, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",0,fakenewsnet,, Obama Just Threw MAJOR Shade At Trump During Last National Security Speech (VIDEO)

"DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh could start relocating Rohingya Muslim refugees to a flood-prone island off its coast in the middle of next year, a government official said on Thursday, as it pushes ahead with the plan despite criticism from aid agencies and rights groups. Densely populated Bangladesh has seen an influx of more than 620,000 Rohingya to its southern-most district of Cox s Bazar, fleeing violence in neighboring Myanmar, since August. This week, it approved a $280 million plan to develop the low-lying Bhashan Char island to temporarily house some of them until they can go home. The Bay of Bengal island, also known as Thenger Char, only emerged from the silt off Bangladesh s delta coast about 11 years ago. Two hours by boat from the nearest settlement, the island has no roads or buildings and it regularly floods during the rough seas of the June-September rainy season. When the sea is calm, pirates roam the waters in the vicinity to kidnap fishermen for ransom. We can t keep such a large number of people in this small area of Cox s Bazar where their presence is having a devastating effect on the situation on the ground environmentally, population wise and economically, H.T. Imam, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina s political adviser, told Reuters on Thursday. So, as quickly as we can shift at least some of the burden over to Bhashan Char, that will minimize the problem. Rohingya have fled repression in Buddhist-majority Myanmar several times since the 1970s, and almost one most million of them live in crowded camps in Cox s Bazar. Mainly Muslim Bangladesh has said it aims to move about 100,000 refugees to the island. Some aid officials speculate that by raising the island plan, Bangladesh could be trying to put pressure on the international community to find a better solution to the crisis. But Imam, who holds the rank of cabinet minister, has denied any such tactic. He said the navy had started work on developing the island, money for which will come from the government. Bangladesh, however, would need financial and other help from aid agencies to move the refugees to the island, he said. There are some organizations which have assured help but I won t specify who they are, Imam said. It s a huge project and includes the development of livestock. They will be given cattle, they will be given land, they will be given houses. They will raise their livestock, there will be other vocations that will be created. Humanitarian agencies, however, have criticized the plan since it was first floated in 2015. Having opened its doors to more than 600,000 Rohingya over the past three months, the Bangladesh government now risks undermining the protection of the Rohingya and squandering the international goodwill it has earned, said Biraj Patnaik, Amnesty International s South Asia Director, referring to the plan to move people to the island. In its desperation to see the Rohingya leave the camps and ultimately return to Myanmar, it is putting their safety and well-being at risk. Myanmar and Bangladesh signed an accord last week on terms for the return of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya, though rights groups have expressed doubts about Myanmar following through on the agreement and have called for independent observers for any repatriation. There are concerns about protection for Rohingya from further violence if and when they go home, and about a path to resolving their legal status - most are stateless - and whether they would be allowed to return to their old homes. Imam said Bangladesh was working on those issues but did not give details. In diplomacy, there are a lot of things that happen but then you don t pronounce them publicly, he said. A lot of back-door diplomatic work is being done. People are involved at the highest level.

"Donald Trump is only one day into his Republican National Convention, and it s already not looking good for him. Not only did several delegates and a fundraiser walk out or resign from his convention, but he also got dissed by House Speaker Paul Ryan all in a matter of a few hours.According to The Hill, Ryan didn t mince his words when discussing Trump at a Wall Street Journal lunch in Cleveland, stating that the business mogul was not my kind of conservative. Ryan said: He s not my kind of conservative, but I come from a different part and wing of the party. I think he is a conservative. There are different kinds of conservatives, that s for darn sure. This is just another comment in a long list of critical remarks Ryan has made about Trump. Ryan has made a point to distance himself from Trump s hateful rhetoric as much as possible even when trying to get the GOP to stand behind the candidate. Previously, Ryan has slammed Trump for his textbook racist comments about Judge Gonzalo Curiel s Mexican heritage, tweeting anti-Semitic images and proposing an all-out ban on Muslims.Over and over, Ryan has made it clear that he disagrees with Trump s views so much that basically the only reason why he is (reluctantly) endorsing the disgraced candidate is that he thinks anything is better than handing the election over to a Democrat. In doing so, Ryan showed America that to him, furthering the Republican party s intolerant values and laws were more important than saving the country from an untrustworthy, dangerously unqualified reality TV star. At the same lunch, Ryan said: What I do know for sure is if we disunify, then we hand the left the country by default for another four years. I just don t want to be a party to that. I don t want to be complicit to that. So, instead, Speaker Ryan wants to be complicit to handing the country to an unqualified bigot.

"Michele Bachmann has been pretty quiet since leaving office under a cloud of scandal and that was a damn shame. She was one of the most perfect examples of how utterly hate-filled and detached from reality the right-wing has become. But apparently Bachmann has remembered that it was her GAWD!-given mission to warn America about all the threats the voices in her head have been making up for years.Last week, Michele warned us about Obama s status as the Anti-Christ and his plan to cancel the elections and crown himself King. This week, GAWD! has told her that the evil Muslims. I kid you not, made up the entire Syrian civil war: This clearly is an invasion, Bachmann said. This is a planned invasion, not only in Europe but also in the United States, I believe for the specific purpose of destroying Western Christendom. The solution, of course, is to close all the borders to people with brown skin immigrants just to be safe. And for those of you who are about to say I m race-baiting, during her rant, Bachmann insisted that we needed to pause immigration just like Calvin Coolidge did in 1924. That pause , incidentally, was targeted specifically to preserve the ideal of American homogeneity (AKA White Supremacy ) by allowing in good immigrants from Western Europe but keeping out the bad ones from Africa, Asia and the Middle East. That s what Michele Bachmann thinks is a solution. Why? Because she s a fucking racist like a great deal of the American right-wing.If this fact upsets you, too bad.But Bachmann wasn t done being a total asshole:Bachmann said that countries with large Muslim minorities like France now experience Islamic jihad 24/7, terrorist bloodbath attacks 24/7, warning that the same thing is coming to the U.S. unless we decide to have no more immigration into the United States. I m sure this will come as a surprise to France. They ll be wondering why they haven t heard about these 24/7 bloodbaths. Maybe they re only happening in the mythical no go zones? Bachmann continues: The more that come in, the more they act upon their religious convictions and their stated religious convictions, she said. The imams from the original countries that they come from, they recruit and send these guys to come in and to bring about this destruction. Right now in Europe it s called a rape culture that s coming into Sweden and Germany and all across Europe for the specific purpose of Islamizing these countries, and they are falling. I wish I could be surprised that a conservative like Bachmann will only acknowledge the existence of rape culture as long as she can blame it on Muslims. Islamists have a plan, Bachmann later added. They have a plan to destroy Western Christendom. It s called civilization jihad. By bringing Islamists into our country and destroying us from in, they don t need to just have a nuclear bomb. If they send their invading army into our countries and if young men are doing what they did on New Year s Eve in Cologne, Germany, and other places where they are literally sexually attacking and raping and groping women and causing them to fear, we are looking at a completely ramped-up level of invasion one like we have never seen before. There are days that I truly and profoundly wish I wasn t an atheist. Why? Because it would give me great comfort to believe that after she dies, Jesus Christ will personally walk up to Bachmann in the afterlife and, after explaining to her exactly how horrible of a human being she was in life, send her to Hell along with most of the Republican Party.Hey, a man can dream, right?Featured image courtesy of Newsweek",0,fakenewsnet,, A**hole Of The Day – Michele Bachmann: Muslim ‘Rape Jihad’ Is Destroying ‘Western Christiandom’

The topic of conversation was centered on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) immigration amnesty program, according to the Democratic lawmakers. After the dinner, Schumer and Pelosi released a statement claiming Trump agreed to support DACA legislation in exchange for the Democrats support in passing a border security package, one without border wall funding. The White House came out afterwards, denying any such agreement was made. Look, what we said was exactly accurate, Schumer said to staffers in reference to his statement.The Democratic senator then recounted to aides what advice he gave the president.

As her fellow spitter-in-the-wind, Serrin Foster, the leader of Feminists For Life, says, There are three key reasons for the feminization of poverty: Lack of education, lack of workplace accommodation and paternal support. Do that, three-fourths of the reasons that women have an abortion are over. And she s not wrong. But that s why the effort to emphasize the life in pro-life is doomed to failure. Talk to most any conservative anti-abortion person and ask them if they support comprehensive sex education, free contraceptives, pre-natal care, post-natal care, food, clothes and housing for the women and babies they re so worried about. The overwhelming majority of them will absolutely refuse. For them, pregnancy is simple a means to an end: Punishing women for having sex.They spend a lot of time crying crocodile tears for the innocent lives being lost but have zero interest in preventing unwanted pregnancies or getting women the support they need to care for a baby they can t afford. It s about control and punishment. And is always has been. A fact that Johnson and her fellow feminists are finding out the hard way:While issues such as expanding family leave requirements and access to child care could be an area of consensus for self-identified pro-life and pro-choice feminists whatever their reasons for supporting them there seemed to be little enthusiasm at the conference for working with pro-choicers on these causes.When Johnson asked who the abortion movement was united behind, an audience member yelled out, the devil! (The answer was Planned Parenthood.) The Devil. Clearly, these are rational people who can think clearly about the best way to prevent abortions. And when Johnson discussed Hillary Clinton, a woman that has spent decades fighting for women s rights? That didn t go so well with the crowd of concerned women Johnson was speaking to:While Clinton has the clearly better record on policies supporting mothers policies that speakers like Foster and Jacobson said help dissuade women from choosing abortion the only positive references to presidential candidates at the event were allusions to Donald Trump s promises to pick Supreme Court justices who would roll back Roe v. Wade. Anti-choice leaders as a whole have rallied behind Trump, who besides vowing to cherish women and appoint anti-choice judges, has not offered any serious plans for improving the lot of women in the workforce or helping women out of poverty.As long as the anti-abortion movement overwhelmingly views an unwanted pregnancy as a punishment for women, they will NEVER stop trying to make abortion illegal in the United States. In a perfect world, Johnson would be leading an army of women to Washington to pass laws giving women everything they need to raise a unplanned child in safety and good health, thus ending almost all need for an abortion. Instead, she s going to waste her time trying to convince women who clearly hate other women that they should really be pro-life instead of pro-control.Good luck with that.Photo by Pete Marovich/Getty Images",0,fakenewsnet,, One Woman Is Trying (And Failing) To Combine Feminism And Anti-Abortion Activism

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senator John McCain warned President Donald Trump on Thursday against nominating any more defense industry insiders to top Pentagon posts, as his committee questioned an executive from Lockheed Martin Corp about potential conflicts of interest. Concern over the close relationship between the Pentagon and arms manufacturers has existed for decades but appears to have intensified under Trump. He has drawn scrutiny for filling posts throughout his government with high-ranking executives. The latest example was his naming this week of former pharmaceutical executive and lobbyist Alex Azar to become Health and Human Services secretary. McCain, chairman of the Senate’s armed services committee, said he was troubled by the number of Defense Department nominees drawn from the defense industry. He said he would oppose any more such nominations after John Rood, Trump’s pick for the Pentagon’s No. 3 job, who appeared before the committee on Thursday. “From this point forward, I will not support any further nominees with that background,” McCain said in a statement. Rood ran into trouble during the hearing over his nomination to become undersecretary of defense for policy. As a Lockheed senior vice president, Rood’s job is to expand the company’s international business. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren pressed him to say if he would recuse himself from discussions with U.S. allies that could benefit Lockheed, the largest U.S. defense contractor with business in 70 countries. Rood said he did not intend to participate in talks about the sale of Lockheed products but did not give the “yes or no” reply sought by Warren, triggering a charged exchange with the committee. McCain joined Warren in demanding a direct answer and warned Rood that otherwise, he was “going to have trouble getting through this committee.” McCain told Rood to submit his response in writing “because obviously you are ducking the answer here.” The uproar came a day after the Senate confirmed Trump’s choice for Army secretary, Mark Esper, who was a top executive at Raytheon, another U.S. defense industry giant. He committed to recusing himself from matters tied to Raytheon. Trump’s Pentagon also has officials who previously worked at Boeing and Textron Systems. U.S. arms manufacturers like Raytheon, whose shares have risen more than 30 percent since December, are expected to benefit in the coming year from an increase in defense spending. The Pentagon says it has 38 unfilled positions for civilian defense leadership roles that require Senate confirmation, and at least 23 nominees whose names have already been submitted to the Senate. It was unclear from McCain’s remarks whether he would oppose any of the already-announced nominees, although he seemed to be warning about future Pentagon picks.",1,fakenewsnet,,McCain warns Trump over staffing Pentagon with industry insiders

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House is vetting federal appellate Judge Jane Kelly for a possible U.S. Supreme Court nomination to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia, the New York Times reported on Wednesday, citing a person with knowledge of the process. The FBI has been conducting background interviews on Kelly, the Times said, citing the unnamed source. Scalia, a long-serving conservative justice, died on Feb. 13. The White House declined to comment on the report. Kelly, a white woman and former public defender, has served on the St. Louis-based 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals since April 2013. She was confirmed to the post by the Senate on a 96-0 vote. She had been mentioned by legal experts as a potential nominee in part because her earlier nomination to the appeals court was supported by Iowa Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee that would review any Supreme Court nomination. Grassley said at the time that Kelly was “well regarded in my home state of Iowa” and that he was “pleased to support” her nomination. Kelly, 51, served as a clerk for now-retired Judge David Hansen, a friend of Grassley who served on the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Republican leaders have so far rebuffed President Barack Obama’s appeal to hold confirmation hearings and a vote on a nominee, including in a face-to-face meeting on Tuesday at the White House that failed to budge them from their vow to block anyone he offers for the job. Republicans say the decision on who to nominate should be left to the next president, who takes office next January after the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. Republicans hope to win back the White House then. Under the U.S. Constitution, the president nominates Supreme Court justices and the Senate must confirm them. Without Scalia, the court has four conservative and four liberal justices, meaning any potential Obama nominee could tip the court to the left for the first time in decades. Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval, a moderate Republican, took himself out of consideration for appointment to the Supreme Court last week, a day after his name surfaced in connection with the Scalia vacancy.",1,fakenewsnet,,Appellate judge Kelly considered for Supreme Court: NYT

"Donald Trump has been having a rough time lately and things came to a head on Thursday when James Comey testified before Congress regarding the president s attempts to obstruct justice. Judging by Friday s press conference, it seems that things are really starting to get to Trump.During a press conference with Romanian President Klaus Iohannis, Trump completely melted down on live television. He debated out loud whether to call on one of the killer networks who are so mean to him with their fake news and finally called on the Washington Times Dave Boyer and warned him to be nice.Boyer asked Trump about Comey s testimony, wondering if there really are tapes that could settle the whole obstruction of justice matter. Trump responded just as you would expect him to.No collusion, no obstruction. He s a leaker, Trump said.He then implied that Comey had committed perjury, lying to Congress about him while under oath. Frankly, James Comey confirmed a lot of what I said, and some of the things that he said just weren t true, he said, seemingly wanting it both ways. Trump denied Comey s accusation that he had pressured the FBI director to drop the investigation into Mike Flynn s Russian ties and asked him to pledge loyalty. But he added that it would have been okay to do even if he had, which he hadn t. (Insert eye roll here.)Boyer then asked the president if he would testify under oath to tell his side of the story and Trump said that he would be 100 percent willing to do so. But the rest of Trump s answer was enough to make the entire country do a collective facepalm.I hardly know the man. I m not going to say I want you to pledge allegiance. Who would do that? Who would ask a man to pledge allegiance under oath? I mean think of it? I hardy know the man. It doesn t make sense. No, I didn t say that and I didn t say the other.For the record, it was at this point that everyone sitting in the room watching the press conference with me screamed, YOU at the television. Trump also promised that we would be hearing more about the alleged tapes in a short period of time. Trump is losing it.

"SAN JUAN (Reuters) - As struggling Puerto Rico enters a bitter election season, discord in the U.S. territory’s ruling party is reaching new heights, which could benefit bondholders. Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla has pushed to force hedge funds, mutual funds and other investors to take losses on the $70 billion Puerto Rico owes them because it cannot repay the debt in full. He says the island's staggering poverty and lack of money to ensure basic services constitutes a humanitarian crisis. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/1PjZvh5) Garcia Padilla, deeply unpopular with exhausted political capital, has dwindling allies among campaigning lawmakers now distancing themselves from him. They may adopt more creditor-friendly policies to counter his populist ideals, experts say. Puerto Rican residents vote in local primaries this Sunday with some members of Garcia Padilla’s Popular Democratic Party locked in tight battles, including Rep. Rafael “Tatito” Hernandez, who runs Puerto Rico’s House finance committee. The island’s election cycle is unique, with all posts decided on the same day every four years, making political campaigns especially heated. Election day, Nov. 8, is a holiday, and voter turnout averages more than 80 percent. The governor will not seek a second term, and financial markets have never given him much credibility. His administration has yet to publish fiscal 2014’s audited financial results. That has fed a perception of irresponsible government, and spurred PDP members to try to distance themselves from his administration. The dynamic could play into the hands of creditors. Garcia Padilla set aside about $200 million in the fiscal 2017 budget toward the $800 million payment due on GO debt July 1, but Hernandez has said he will lobby to earmark enough to pay it all. “There is a lot of lobbying here by bondholders, and one of the big issues is whether to include money to pay that debt in next year’s budget,” Sergio Marxuach, a San Juan-based economist, said in an interview. A law signed in April, giving the governor authority to issue moratoriums on debt payments, could be scaled back, said Height Securities analyst Daniel Hanson, who follows Puerto Rico. “Our base case has been that the budget will be used as leverage to amend back parts of the moratorium,” Hanson said. While these local fights play out, the U.S. Congress has been debating a bill that would pull Puerto Rico’s finances under federal oversight and allow the government to restructure its bond debt. The governor, though never wildly popular, has had some success pushing his agenda. But lately the wheels have come off, even though his party has controlled the House and Senate since 2013. Key party leaders, like Hernandez and former Secretary of State David Bernier, the PDP’s gubernatorial candidate, have openly criticized him. Garcia Padilla’s own economy minister, Alberto Baco Bague, publicly questioned the legitimacy of the humanitarian crisis, telling local media in May the narrative was a political “strategy.” Baco declined to comment for this story. Last week, in a boon for businesses, the legislature repealed a new round of tax hikes on professional services, the same bill it had approved just last year on the strength of Garcia Padilla’s message of financial desperation. Adding to the chaos, a group of Puerto Rico creditors sued Garcia Padilla’s administration over the legality of the debt moratorium, despite having signed an agreement barring lawsuits while sides negotiated a restructuring. The move reflected ever-growing acrimony between the government and its creditors, Hanson said. A spokeswoman for Garcia Padilla’s office had no immediate comment. Like Baco’s criticism, much of the internal discord turns on whether there is actually a humanitarian crisis. But while that argument may be losing political steam, it should not be disregarded, Marxuach said. The message has resonated with Democrats in Washington, including U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and Rep. Raul Grijalva, who made separate visits to Puerto Rico in May to stress the dire human circumstances on the island. “Puerto Rico is at a moment of necessity and crisis,” Lew said May 9 in San Juan. Marxuach said the crisis is not so much a ticking time bomb, “it’s a slow burn.” Public pensions covering 330,000 beneficiaries are the worst-funded of any state-level U.S. pension this century, set to run out of cash in three years. Hospitals face staffing shortfalls as doctors flee to better-paying jobs on the mainland. The island’s poverty rate is at 45 percent; unemployment is near 12 percent, and higher in rural towns. Puerto Ricans’ ability to emigrate to the mainland is an escape hatch that mitigates the economic stress and political pressure to fix it. But for those without the ability to escape the burdens just grow. “The debt stays the same,” said Marxuach, “but the economy grows even less.”",1,fakenewsnet,,"As Puerto Rico government frays, bondholders might get paid"

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The overseers of the U.S. intelligence community have not embraced a CIA assessment that Russian cyber attacks were aimed at helping Republican President-elect Donald Trump win the 2016 election, three American officials said on Monday. While the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) does not dispute the CIA’s analysis of Russian hacking operations, it has not endorsed their assessment because of a lack of conclusive evidence that Moscow intended to boost Trump over Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton, said the officials, who declined to be named. The position of the ODNI, which oversees the 17 agency-strong U.S. intelligence community, could give Trump fresh ammunition to dispute the CIA assessment, which he rejected as “ridiculous” in weekend remarks, and press his assertion that no evidence implicates Russia in the cyber attacks. Trump’s rejection of the CIA’s judgment marks the latest in a string of disputes over Russia’s international conduct that have erupted between the president-elect and the intelligence community he will soon command. An ODNI spokesman declined to comment on the issue. “ODNI is not arguing that the agency (CIA) is wrong, only that they can’t prove intent,” said one of the three U.S. officials. “Of course they can’t, absent agents in on the decision-making in Moscow.” The Federal Bureau of Investigation, whose evidentiary standards require it to make cases that can stand up in court, declined to accept the CIA’s analysis - a deductive assessment of the available intelligence - for the same reason, the three officials said. The ODNI, headed by James Clapper, was established after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the recommendation of the commission that investigated the attacks. The commission, which identified major intelligence failures, recommended the office’s creation to improve coordination among U.S. intelligence agencies. In October, the U.S. government formally accused Russia of a campaign of cyber attacks against American political organizations ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election. Democratic President Barack Obama has said he warned Russian President Vladimir Putin about consequences for the attacks. Reports of the assessment by the CIA, which has not publicly disclosed its findings, have prompted congressional leaders to call for an investigation. Obama last week ordered intelligence agencies to review the cyber attacks and foreign intervention in the presidential election and to deliver a report before he turns power over to Trump on Jan. 20. The CIA assessed after the election that the attacks on political organizations were aimed at swaying the vote for Trump because the targeting of Republican organizations diminished toward the end of the summer and focused on Democratic groups, a senior U.S. official told Reuters on Friday. Moreover, only materials filched from Democratic groups - such as emails stolen from John Podesta, the Clinton campaign chairman - were made public via WikiLeaks, the anti-secrecy organization, and other outlets, U.S. officials said. The CIA conclusion was a “judgment based on the fact that Russian entities hacked both Democrats and Republicans and only the Democratic information was leaked,” one of the three officials said on Monday. “(It was) a thin reed upon which to base an analytical judgment,” the official added. Republican Senator John McCain said on Monday there was “no information” that Russian hacking of American political organizations was aimed at swaying the outcome of the election. “It’s obvious that the Russians hacked into our campaigns,” McCain said. “But there is no information that they were intending to affect the outcome of our election and that’s why we need a congressional investigation,” he told Reuters. McCain questioned an assertion made on Sunday by Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, tapped by Trump to be his White House chief of staff, that there were no hacks of computers belonging to Republican organizations. “Actually, because Mr. Priebus said that doesn’t mean it’s true,” said McCain. “We need a thorough investigation of it, whether both (Democratic and Republican organizations) were hacked into, what the Russian intentions were. We cannot draw a conclusion yet. That’s why we need a thorough investigation.” In an angry letter sent to ODNI chief Clapper on Monday, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes said he was “dismayed” that the top U.S. intelligence official had not informed the panel of the CIA’s analysis and the difference between its judgment and the FBI’s assessment. Noting that Clapper in November testified that intelligence agencies lacked strong evidence linking Russian cyber attacks to the WikiLeaks disclosures, Nunes asked that Clapper, together with CIA and FBI counterparts, brief the panel by Friday on the latest intelligence assessment of Russian hacking during the election campaign.",1,fakenewsnet,,Exclusive: Top U.S. spy agency has not embraced CIA assessment on Russia hacking - sources

When they were asked about Lindsay, the Cruz campaign apparently panicked.Lindsay has appeared in several softcore porn films, including Erotic Confessions, Carnal Wishes, Secrets of a Chambermaid, and Insatiable Desires.BuzzFeed News, after learning of Lindsay s prior filmography, requested comment from the Cruz campaign. Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler told BuzzFeed News in a statement that the campaign is taking the ad down and replacing it with a different one. The actress responded to an open casting call. She passed her audition and got the job. Unfortunately, she was not vetted by the production company.

He came in third place in the New Hampshire primary after winning the Iowa caucuses, and hopes to capitalize on social conservative support in order to win the South Carolina primary.Cruz was supported by the right-wing conservative Family Leader, who in the past has called for opposition to pornography which it lumped in with abortion and prostitution as a type of coercion or stolen innocence.

"Nashua, NEW HAMPSHIRE (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said on Tuesday that she would consider making investment income taxable through Social Security deductions in a bid to keep the government program afloat, the Wall Street Journal reported. Clinton, the front-runner for the party’s nomination in the Nov. 2016 contest, made the comments while campaigning in Iowa, where her lead has slipped in recent weeks ahead of the state’s early voting contest. “I am worried about certain recipients because I think it’s important to enhance the benefits,” the Journal reported Clinton as saying at a campaign event in the city of Decorah. “We do have to extend the life of the trust fund and that’s going to take some new funding,” she said. The newspaper reported that Clinton would consider raising to an undisclosed amount the maximum income that would be subject to the 6.2 percent Social Security tax. Under the current rule, money made from investments, as well as pensions, annuities and interest, are not considered income, and only the first $118,500 wages are subject to the tax. Fears over the solvency of the Social Security system have made it an important election issue. Clinton’s main rival for the Democratic nomination, Bernie Sanders, has described Social Security as the nation’s “most successful government program,” and has called for its expansion, which he says will be paid for by lifting the cap on taxable income above $250,000. Voters in Iowa will cast some of the country’s earliest ballot’s in the caucus nominating contest on Feb. 1.

"How very Presidential She s cold calculating..deceitful but she has a vagina, so that s a good enough reason for women to vote for her. After all..it s Hillary s turn! So vote for the wife of a rapist, who laughs about getting child rapists off with plea bargains. It s been 16 long years without a Clinton in the White House let s make America Sleazy again!It s time to make history with the first female President because our first Historic black President worked out so well In a newly unearthed audio interview Hillary Clinton reveals how she managed to get a plea bargain for a man accused of raping a 12-year-old girl and shockingly laughs as she indicated she knew he may have been guilty.During the course of the conversation which dates from the early 1980s, Clinton, then 27, outlines how she used a mistake by the prosecution to get 41-year-old Thomas Alfred Taylor to walk free.Indeed, so cavalier is her attitude to securing the freedom of a man suspected of raping a child that the shocking and candid interview may tarnish her role as an advocate for women and children in the United States.The recordings which date from 1983-1987 were discovered by the Washington Free Beacon and are of Clinton recalling her role in the most important criminal case of her career.Who knew Killary had such a strong southern accent?This is not the first time that the trial has been written about.In 2008 at the height of her primary battle with Barack Obama, a Newsday story focused on Clinton s deeply controversial strategy of attacking the credibility of the girl. Rodham, records show, questioned the sixth grader s honesty and claimed she had made false accusations in the past. She implied that the girl often fantasized and sought out older men like Taylor, according to a July 1975 affidavit signed Hillary D. Rodham in compact cursive, wrote Newsday.The girl was a family friend and Clinton has acknowledged in her past 2003 memoir, Living History, the difficulties the case provided her having just moved to Fayetteville. to run the University of Arkansas new legal aid clinic. This guy was accused of raping a 12-year-old. Course he claimed that he didn t, and all this stuff, says Clinton.However, what is most shocking is the breezy manner in which she discusses her clients crime and the offhand way in which she questions his innocence. I had him take a polygraph, which he passed which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs, she says with a laugh.Indeed, Clinton laughs during several different parts of the interview especially when she discusses the forensic lab destroying key evidence which led to Taylor getting away with the crime.But, Ronald Rotunda, a professor of legal ethics at Chapman University, told the Washington Free Beacon. We don t have to believe the client is innocent our job is to represent the client in the best way we can within the bounds of the law. However, he did raise the possibility that Clinton may have breached the attorney-client privilege by discussing the case so openly. You can t do that, he said. Unless the client says: You re free to tell people that you really think I m a scumbag, and the only reason I got a lighter sentence is because you re a really clever lawyer.

Last night we conducted strikes in northern Helmand to hit the Taliban where it hurts, in their narcotics financing, said Nicholson, flanked by Afghan Army Lieutenant General Mohammad Sharif Yaftali. The southern province of Helmand suffers heavy fighting and is the single-largest producer of opium. Opium production in Afghanistan reached record highs this year, up 87 percent on last year, the United Nations said last week. The U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said output of opium made from poppy seeds in Afghanistan, the world s main source of heroin, stands at around 9,000 metric tons this year. UNODC has warned in the past that Kabul s weakening grip on security was contributing to a collapse in eradication efforts. Nearly half of Afghan opium is processed, or refined into morphine or heroin, before it is trafficked out of the country, according to U.S. and Afghan officials. We re determined to tackle criminal economy and narcotics trafficking with full force, said Afghan President Ashraf Ghani on Twitter. Nicholson said the attacks were part of U.S. President Donald Trump s new policy toward Afghanistan as he boosts troop numbers. The four-star general showed one video of an F-22 fighter jet dropping 250-pound bombs on two buildings, emphasizing that a nearby third building was left unscathed. U.S. troops have long been accused of causing unnecessary collateral damage and civilian deaths. The United States says it takes every precaution to avoid civilian casualties. The United Nations said at least 10 civilians may have been killed by a strike in Kunduz earlier this month, contradicting a U.S. investigation that found no civilian deaths.",1,fakenewsnet,,"U.S., Afghan forces strike opium factories to curb Taliban funds"

"GLASGOW, Scotland (Reuters) - Scotland s former first minister believes the independence movement has a three-year window after Britain quits the European Union to push again for seccession, despite the Scottish National Party s losses in an election in June. Salmond, who is still very influential in the movement, said the independence drive could be refreshed by proposing to join the European Free Trade Association, which would give Scotland European single market membership. The SNP lost a third of its seats in the national election, including Salmond s own seat, in a sign of waning enthusiasm for another Scottish independence referendum after the uncertainties thrown up by Brexit. Despite that, support for independence itself has remained at the 45 percent level it was when it was voted down in 2014 and the SNP still holds 35 of Scotland s 59 seats in the Westminster parliament. Salmond said Brexit was proving to be disastrous for Britain and would only end in humiliation . Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to keep EU membership while Wales and most-populous England voted to leave at last year s referendum, straining the ties of the four-nation United Kingdom. So the SNP were and are right about Brexit, but as we found out to our cost in the election just being right does not necessarily make for popularity. Nor does it absolve us of a responsibility to attempt to create order out of chaos, he told a Business for Scotland annual dinner. We have 18 months of Brexit negotiations and after that perhaps a three-year period of transition to get our ducks in a row. Salmond said, in a speech peppered with jibes at the government s Brexit talks, which have faltered in recent weeks. He said that EFTA membership could be a prelude to full EU membership if necessary. We have to offer something which is doable, feasible and speedily deliverable for the European connections of an independent Scotland, he said,",1,fakenewsnet,,Scotland's SNP must come up with 'doable' independence plan after Brexit: Salmond

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican lawmakers should follow their conscience on whether to support Donald Trump in November’s presidential election, U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan has said in an interview, reflecting the party’s unease over its White House candidate. “The last thing I would do is tell anybody to do something that’s contrary to their conscience. Of course I wouldn’t do that,” the Republicans’ most senior elected official said in excerpts released on Friday of an NBC interview set to air on Sunday. Some Republican leaders and lawmakers in the House of Representatives are struggling to get behind the New York businessman, who last month became the party’s presumptive nominee for the Nov. 8 election. After an initial delay, Ryan has said he will back Trump but he has also acknowledged deep differences with him. He denounced as textbook racism Trump’s criticism of a Mexican-American judge and has also criticized Trump’s proposal - reiterated after the massacre of 49 people in a gay bar in Orlando on Sunday - to temporarily bar Muslims from the United States. As Republicans seek to keep control of both chambers of Congress, Trump’s comments on such issues have also worried some lawmakers concerned about their own election prospects, particularly in close races. All 247 House Republican seats are up for grabs in the election. Trump, who has welcomed support from Ryan, this week fired back at Republican leaders, telling them to stop speaking out against him or else risk him potentially running “by myself.” Ryan said earlier this week at his weekly press conference that he does not plan to withdraw his support of Trump, although they disagree on some key issues. “I feel as a responsibility institutionally as the speaker of the House that I should not be leading some chasm in the middle of our party. Because you know what I know that’ll do? That’ll definitely knock us out of the White House,” Ryan said in the interview for NBC’s “Meet the Press” program. Trump’s embrace this week of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community and potential gun control measures, in contrast to general Republican orthodoxy have also thrown conservative lawmakers. Still, Republican leaders have to reconcile their unease with the fact that primary Republican voters opted for Trump. He has never held elected office before but won more than enough delegates to secure the party’s nomination at the Republican convention in July.",1,fakenewsnet,,Ryan says Republicans should follow 'conscience' on Trump

"Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the planner of the terrorist attacks that hit Paris on November 13, 2015, was killed after a raid led by French authorities who stormed an apartment in the town of Saint-Denis. It has now been revealed that police found Abaaoud in part thanks to information given to them by a Muslim woman.She has now revealed her faith because she wants the world to know the following:But until now, the public has been unaware that the critical tip in the hunt for Abaaoud came from a Muslim one of millions who now face a backlash in Europe fueled by anger over the attacks in Paris and Brussels, as well as fear and resentment of a rising tide of refugees. It s important the world knows that I am Muslim myself, the woman said, citing that as a reason for being willing to speak to The Post. It s important to me that people know what Abaaoud and the others did is not what Islam is teaching. Too often after terrorist incidents, people particularly conservatives act as if Islam is the only faith that extremists use as justification for mass murder, ignoring the history of other faiths (including Christianity) being perverted.When terrorists have hit America the hardest, their attacks did not discriminate by faith. In fact, one estimate says that 32 Muslims were killed in the 9/11 attacks.Ironically, even though his administration declared war on Iraq, it was President George W. Bush who often went to great lengths to point out there was a distinction between those who practice peaceful Islam, and the terrorist hijackers. And that sentiment has continued with President Obama, who pointed out that when discussing Americans and those with Islamic faith, it s not them or us, it s just us. This woman s example shows that blanket condemnations of Muslims, as agitators like Donald Trump have engaged in, are backwards and just flat-out incorrect.Featured image via YouTube",0,fakenewsnet,, Muslim Woman Who Turned In Paris Terrorist Shares Important Thought With The World

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who oversees the Federal Bureau of Investigation, on Friday offered a tepid endorsement of the nation’s leading law enforcement agency, which has been under attack by President Donald Trump and other Republicans. Trump said earlier this month that the FBI’s reputation was in “tatters” after news came to light that an FBI agent on a team investigating links between Russia and Trump’s election campaign had exchanged anti-Trump text messages with an FBI lawyer. Sessions on Friday defended the bureau, which is part of the Department of Justice that he leads, but it was not an enthusiastic endorsement. “I don’t share the view that the FBI is not functioning at a high level all over the country,” he told a news conference. Sessions’ comments came at a time when former FBI director Robert Mueller is leading an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. A sampling of texts between agent Peter Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page was released to Congress and the media earlier this week. The two referred to Trump as an “idiot,” but also took aim at other politicians, including Democrat Hillary Clinton, who lost to Trump in the 2016 election, and independent Bernie Sanders, who had sought the Democratic nomination for president. Strzok was transferred off Mueller’s team, but the texts provided fresh fodder for some Republicans who have fiercely criticized Mueller in a move that Democrats say is an effort to discredit his Russia investigation. Russia has denied meddling in the 2016 election, and Trump has repeatedly said his campaign did not collude with Russia. Sessions is the latest senior official to defend the FBI. His comments were much milder than those of FBI Director Christopher Wray and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in recent testimony to Congress. Sessions said Trump does support the FBI and noted that Trump spoke earlier on Friday to a class of domestic and international law enforcement managers graduating from an FBI training program in Quantico, Virginia. However, the audience did not consist of FBI agents, and Trump’s speech was to local and state police officers. Sessions also ducked a question about whether he will appoint a second special counsel to investigate some of the bias allegations against Mueller’s team, as some Republicans have demanded.",1,fakenewsnet,,Attorney General Sessions has lukewarm praise for FBI after Trump attack

"NAIROBI (Reuters) - South Sudan s army clashed with rebels in an oil-producing region early on Sunday, both sides said, shattering a ceasefire hours after it came into effect. Both sides accused the other of starting the fighting around the town of Koch in Unity state. Seventeen aid workers fled the violence, according to a humanitarian source. There were no immediate details of casualties. The government and rebel groups signed a ceasefire on Thursday in the latest attempt to end a four-year civil war and let humanitarian groups reach civilians. The ceasefire formally came into force on Sunday morning, but fighting broke out soon afterwards, according to a humanitarian security report seen by Reuters. Our forces came under heavy fire this morning in Koch county, Dickson Gatluak, a spokesman for the government side, said. Our forces acted in self defense and repulsed the attacking forces and defeated them, he added in a statement. Rebel spokesman Lam Paul Gabriel said the army attacked first and rebel forces were now pursuing government soldiers towards the town. The world s youngest country plunged into war in late 2013 after President Salva Kiir sacked his deputy, Riek Machar. The dispute erupted into fighting that spread across the country, largely along ethnic lines between forces loyal to Kiir, who is Dinka, and Machar, who is Nuer. The violence, which the United Nations says has amounted to ethnic cleansing, has forced a third of the population to flee.

why you should become a minimalist why you should become a minimalist february comments lifestyle the most abused word in the english language is need if youre reading this post i contend there is little that you actually need beyond what you currently possess you have ample electricity to power your computer in a climatecontrolled environment with running water and food in your wellstocked refrigerator why then do you always hear people talking about how they need more stuff humans have a deeplyrooted drive to compete with each other and advertisers capitalize on this impulse take a moment to picture the average person that you meet what do they have to take pride in buying the newest thing allows them to join the club of consumers and for a fleeting moment to be measured on an equal playing field despite their personal shortcomings the internal pain of their lifes problems dissipates for the split second they can boast superiority over everyone who doesnt have the same shiny widget this conspicuous consumption creates a selffulfilling egoinvestment in the broken system although borrowing money for useless luxury purchases subjugates people into debt slavery the mentality is if i paid for this hunk of metal and im working overtime to pay it off it must be worth it and so are other things that the commercials are telling me to buy quite literally we are working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we dont need if youre reading this blog you are likely a male aged who wants to do one or more of the following quit your job travel explore a locationindependent income get yourself in shape take charge of a relationship and learn valuable life skills a minimalist mentality helps you do all of these things having fewer possessions forces you to properly place a higher value on experiences this will make it safer and more fulfilling to travel because you are in touch with what truly makes you happy if youre working on a side hustle or starting a business the desire for needless possessions drains your disposable income levels and prevents you from taking risks if my business fails will i have to give up my car lease preempt this loss aversion by having less to lose if you want to move to a better city with a higher cost of living having excess stuff sets a floor on how much rent youll pay to house your crap and in turn how much you can spend on leisure activities if youre a distractable person like me removing visual noise from your area makes you more likely to create things with your mind and less likely to fixate on your environment throwing or giving useless things away is a good first step since possessions have a psychic weight that you may not realize until you rid yourself of them to fully embrace this mindset you must also kill the desires that have been inculcated in you since birth cut down on your consumer impressions by watching less tv and trying to rationally dissect the techniques used in the few advertisements you encounter find fulfillment in hobbies and work rather than chasing the rush and eventual hedonic adaptation from consuming much like a drug successive bouts of consumerism create a higher baseline where your overall happiness is no different but you end up having a bunch of useless crap that ties you down girls can also be troublesome in this endeavor ever notice that when a girl spends extended time in your living space she beings to tell you that you need a new this or a replacement that a good friend once told me all human beings have an innate desire to create most women cant so they redecorate limit your exposure to women who attempt to thwart a separation from consumerism ironically men likely to lead a minimalistnomadic lifestyle are simply more attractive to primesmv women think about whether the starving artist or the bottle service guy throwing money around ends up getting more ass as always watch how women behave rather than listening to what they say when they are protesting your lifestyle change ask yourself this if your house burned down and you had nothing but the clothes on your back what would you be worth to society and to yourself how would you feel about losing all of the possessions you own most people plugged into the matrix would rather die than think about replacing aunt gladyss vase or baby pictures they havent looked at in a decade this is an illusion once you begin to divorce yourself from this emotional investment to stuff you will implicitly place more value on your skills and past experiences minimalism is not a synonym for frugality or cheapness i dont wear a potato sack while pedaling a used tricycle to work every day i simply choose to allocate my money to experiences and a few possessions that will fulfill me and advance my lifes purpose rather than enslave myself into debt for trinkets that will collect dust somewhere taking the red pill is about learning to separate your priorities and desires from those that society forces upon you i dont promise that adopting this mindset will make everybody happy but it will certainly help to clarify what contributes to your individual sense of

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. House of Representatives committee said on Friday that it has scheduled a new hearing on Kaspersky Lab software as lawmakers review accusations that the Kremlin could use its products to conduct espionage. Kaspersky Lab has strongly denied those allegations, which last month prompted the Trump administration to order civilian government agencies to purge the software from its networks, and agreed to send Chief Executive Eugene Kaspersky to Washington to testify before Congress. The House Committee on Science, Space and Technology announced the Oct. 25 hearing a day after reports that Russian government-backed hackers stole highly classified U.S. cyber secrets in 2015 from a National Security Agency contractor who had Kaspersky software installed on his laptop. The House science committee did not say who would be called to testify at the hearing. Eugene Kaspersky last month told Reuters that the committee had invited him to testify at a Sept. 27 hearing and that he would attend if he could get an expedited visa to enter the United States. That hearing was later canceled, though the committee held a closed-door classified session on Kaspersky software on Sept. 26. Eugene Kaspersky said in a statement on Friday that he hoped to attend the hearing. “I look forward to participating in the hearing once it’s rescheduled and having the opportunity to address the committee’s concerns directly,” he said. An appearance before Congress would mark Kaspersky’s most high-profile attempt to dispel long-standing accusations that his firm may be conducting espionage on behalf of the Russian government. The investigation into the 2015 NSA hack is focused on somebody who worked at the agency’s Tailored Access Operations unit, a unit that uses computer hacking to gather intelligence, according to two people familiar with the classified probe. Kaspersky anti-virus software was running on the contractor’s laptop at the time of the hack, and investigators are looking into whether hackers used the software to breach the computer and steal the data, said one of those sources.",1,fakenewsnet,,U.S. House committee calls new hearing on Kaspersky software

"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia s ruling party united behind scandal-tainted Prime Minister Najib Razak as he prepares for a general election due by August by deciding on Friday that he could stand unopposed in a party leadership contest due some time next year. Najib is hoping to win a third term despite the multi-billion dollar corruption scandal at 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) that has dogged his premiership for the last two years. Najib has consistently denied any wrongdoing at the state fund, which he founded and served as chairman of the advisory board. At its last annual party conference before a general election, the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) gave both Najib and his deputy, Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, a free pass to retain their posts in a party leadership ballot next year. Therefore, in the spirit of togetherness and mutuality... state-run news agency Bernama quoted permanent chairman Badruddin Amiruldin as saying, it is decided at this assembly that the post of president held by Datuk Seri Najib Razak and the post of deputy president Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, will not be contested in the coming elections. When the 1MDB controversy first erupted in 2015, Najib quashed an internal revolt after some UMNO leaders asked him to step down and he blocked an inquiry into the affair. Leadership elections were postponed as he went on to purge the party of dissent while he also dropped his former liberal image, cracking down on opponents and civil society, as he moved UMNO closer to conservative Islamist values, worrying Malaysia s sizable Chinese and Indian minorities. Addressing the conference earlier this week, Najib called for loyalty from UMNO s 3.4 million members. Have absolute loyalty and obey all the instructions of the top leadership, he said in a keynote address to the party faithful. Four years ago, UMNO crept back into power despite registering its worst ever election performance, as an opposition front led the charismatic Anwar Ibrahim called foul after losing despite winning the popular vote. This time, however, the challenge is coming from the veteran Mahathir Mohamad - who gave up the premiership in 2003 after 22 years in power and had been Najib s political mentor. Mahathir, has come out of retirement to team up with Anwar - who is languishing in jail having been convicted in a case that both he and independent observers say was politically motivated. A rebounding economy and strengthening ringgit currency have helped Najib improve his image among Malaysians, who have been frustrated with the corruption and rising living costs. But the 1MDB scandal refuses to go away, with U.S. Attorney General this week referring to the case as the worst example of kleptocracy that the Department of Justice had investigated.",1,fakenewsnet,,Malaysia's ruling party unites behind Najib as election looms

"In an op-ed that puts to rest any notion that Ted Cruz knows what he s talking about when it comes to terrorism and national security, NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton did not hold back.In the wake of the ISIS attack on Brussels, the Texas Senator went on camera to call for mass surveillance of Muslims in communities across the country as well as increased police patrols in those neighborhoods. Because spying on and treating Muslims like criminals is going to somehow prevent them from radicalizing.Not so, says Bratton, who wrote in his op-ed in New York Daily News that what Cruz believes about Muslims is fiction and that the outcome he seeks is a fairy tale. Recently, Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz called for police to patrol and secure Muslim communities before they become radicalized. We already patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods, the same way we patrol and secure other neighborhoods, Bratton wrote.We do not patrol and secure neighborhoods based on selective enforcement because of race or religion, nor will we use the police and an occupying force to intimidate a populace or a religion to appease the provocative chatter of politicians seeking to exploit fear.Nor will we accept the fiction of Sen. Cruz s narrative as presented. Cruz repeated the false reports surrounding the NYPD Demographics Unit and my decision to abolish it because it wasn t serving any useful purpose. He tried to depict the demise of the unit, as other ill-informed observers have done, as a knuckling under to the forces of political correctness rather than the sensible administrative decision that it was. The fact is that the former administration had allowed the unit to dwindle down to two investigators. Why? Because the work of the unit, which was to map the ethnic makeup of the city to better understand the domain of the New York metropolitan area, was finished. The two remaining detectives simply had little to do.Bratton then dropped the hammer on Cruz. It is clear from his comments that Sen. Cruz knows absolutely nothing about counterterrorism in New York City. We have in this city, without a doubt, the most effective and extensive counterterrorism capacity of any city in this country and virtually any city in the world. Bratton went on to literally list the taskforces that work hard to provide counterterrorism for New York City, including the Joint-Terrorism Task Force with the FBI, Critical Response Command, NYPD Counterterrorism Bureau, NYPD Intelligence Bureau, and the NYPD Domain Awareness System.In the end, Bratton explained that over 900 police officers under his command are Muslims who work hard to keep the city and their own families safe from terrorists every day and schooled Cruz on the Constitution before cautioning him to actually do some damn research before opening his mouth again.Sen. Cruz s references to the discontinuance of the Demographics Unit shows he has been hoodwinked by a 21st century fairy tale that refuses to die. He uses it in tandem with his suggestions that the police create a looming presence to intimidate Muslim neighborhoods with a show of force.In New York City, we protect all communities from crime and terrorism yes, Muslim communities too because like us, they are Americans who own businesses, work hard, pay taxes and dream of a better life for their children. Over 900 of them work in my police department as police officers, many of them in counterterrorism and intelligence. Many of them have served in the military and fought for their country. We police our city not by campaign slogans or inflammatory rhetoric, but by an old piece of parchment called the U.S. Constitution and another called the Bill of Rights.Ted Cruz and others seem to be willing to sideline these principles because what they stand for shifts with the tide of the campaign and the shrillness of the name-calling. But as it has been said, when you stand for nothing, you will fall for anything. Sen. Cruz needs to do some homework before he speaks again.Enough said.Featured image via Flickr",0,fakenewsnet,, NYPD Commissioner OBLITERATES Ted Cruz’s ‘Fictional’ Knowledge Of Counterterrorism

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s disavowal this week of a bipartisan agreement to stabilize Obamacare has further eroded the already minimal trust congressional Democrats had in him, complicating prospects for gaining their cooperation on a range of issues. Trump’s fellow Republicans who control Congress will need at least some Democratic support to pass critical legislation in the coming months to avert a government shutdown and prevent an unprecedented U.S. debt default. “I’ve been here with every president since Jerry Ford,” said Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy, who was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1974 and is its longest-serving member. “I’ve always been willing to negotiate with anybody because they always keep their word. If you have a president who doesn’t keep his word, it makes it more difficult,” Leahy said when asked about Trump’s interactions with Congress. Trump initially backed the bipartisan deal announced on Tuesday by Democratic Senator Patty Murray and Republican Senator Lamar Alexander for shoring up insurance marketplaces established under Obamacare for two years by reviving federal subsidies to private insurers that Trump has scrapped. A day later, Trump disowned it. Going forward, Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen said that while more collaboration with Trump is possible, “I think we have to know that we can’t count on him.” Trump enraged Republicans in September with his collaboration with top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer and top House of Representatives Democrat Nancy Pelosi. Trump cut a short-term spending deal with them, blindsiding Republican leaders, and then discussed with them the outlines of a plan to revive protections for young adult immigrants dubbed “Dreamers” brought into the United States illegally as children. On both healthcare and Dreamers, Trump has shown that while he relishes deal-making, he is quick to row back in the face of a conservative backlash. The president also has sent signals over the past few weeks that he is wavering on working with Democrats to help the Dreamers, making demands that could be a deal-breaker. Republicans have worked seven years to get rid of Obamacare, Democratic former President Barack Obama’s signature legislative achievement, and many of them vehemently opposed the Alexander-Murray deal. It remains unclear whether it will ever come to a vote in the Senate or House. Because spending legislation requires a super-majority of 60 votes in the 100-seat Senate and there are 52 Republican senators, it cannot pass without at least eight Democrats backing it. Because hard-line House conservatives often oppose spending bills, Democratic support is expected to be needed there as well. A Dec. 8 deadline is looming for passing the spending measure needed to prevent a shutdown. Democrats could demand a steep price for their support, potentially an Obamacare fix and action to help the Dreamers. Under a budget resolution passed by the Senate on Thursday night, Republicans need only a simple majority to pass Trump’s proposed major tax cuts, though he has urged Democrats to support the overhaul. Schumer, who Trump earlier in the year called the Democrats’ “head clown” before their thaw last month, this week vented his frustration about the president, saying he “keeps zigging and zagging so it’s impossible to govern.” “This president cannot govern if, whenever the hard right frightens him and says ‘jump,’ he says ‘how high?’” Schumer told reporters on Wednesday. Schumer and Pelosi dined at the White House with Trump last month, and left feeling as if they had a deal on a proposal to help continue protections for the Dreamers that the president has moved to end effective in March. Within a day, Trump began distancing himself from that deal, with the White House later floating a series of hard-line immigration “principles,” including money for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border fiercely opposed by Democrats, that have thrown the entire effort into doubt. Pelosi and Schumer argue their deal with Trump is still salvageable, as the president himself has not called it off. Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill acknowledged that the principles “don’t help” the effort. But Hammill said that would not stop Pelosi, a former House speaker first elected to the chamber in 1987, from engaging Trump in the future. “It was always a case-by-case thing. It was never ‘the switch was on’” full-time, Hammill said. There will be plenty of cases to come in the weeks ahead, giving Trump an opportunity to improve his relations with Democrats if that is what he wants, Hammill said. As Congress and the White House approach the December deadline for settling fiscal affairs, Hammill said Trump can use that opportunity to stabilize Obamacare and shield Dreamers from deportation. “If he’s unable to do that, we’re unable to work with him on his priorities,” including taxes, Hammill said.",1,fakenewsnet,,Trump's Obamacare shift complicates ability to work with Democrats

"This morning, Kellyanne Conway attempted to spin White House press secretary Sean Spicer s blatant lies about Trump s inauguration numbers into simply an alternate version of the truth. This isn t the first time she s said something like this, and so it s getting more than a little ridiculous. Fortunately, Chuck Todd nailed her to the wall for it, but he wasn t the only one. Merriam-Webster decided to nail her for it too, with a short, concise tweet:?A fact is a piece of information presented as having objective reality. Merriam-Webster January 22, 2017Nothing like having the dictionary troll you when you try to redefine words in front of the whole damn world.Merriam-Webster didn t stop with just a single tweet, though. That link goes to an entire article blasting Conway for pretending the word fact doesn t mean what we think it means. In addition to the modern definition, which is their tweet, they gave three obsolete definitions which further puts Conway to shame: There are three obsolete senses of fact in English. Two of these senses are no longer used:Fact meaning a wrong or unlawful deed is rare, but is still used in the phrase after the fact. Merriam-Webster also reported, in that story, that lookups for the word fact spiked after Conway spewed her nonsense all over Chuck Todd. Fact is their #2 lookup today, and feminism is their #3 lookup. Their #1 lookup, though? Fascism. That s been one of their trending lookups for a few months now, which says something about how people on both sides view Trump.You know you ve screwed up big time with a word when you ve got the dictionary coming after you for it.Featured image by Yana Paskova via Getty Images",0,fakenewsnet,, The Dictionary Delivers EPIC Smackdown Of Kellyanne Conway’s ‘Alternative Facts’ Bullsh*t

"(Reuters) - A woman has accused Roy Moore, the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in Alabama, of initiating a sexual encounter with her when she was 14 years old and he was 32, the Washington Post reported on Thursday, prompting top Republicans to say he should step aside if the allegations prove true. Moore, 70, the state’s former chief judge, vehemently denied the allegations, calling them “completely false and a desperate political attack.” U.S. President Donald Trump would want Moore to step aside if the allegations against him are true, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said on Friday. “Like most Americans, the president believes we cannot allow a mere allegation, in this case one from many years ago, to destroy a person’s life,” Sanders said. “However, the president also believes that if these allegations are true, Judge Moore will do the right thing and step aside,” she said, as Trump arrived in Vietnam on his 12-day Asia tour. In a series of Twitter posts later in the day, Moore cast the published allegations against him part of a bid to “silence and shut up Christian conservatives like you and me,” adding “I will NEVER GIVE UP the fight!” Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, working with a slim 52-48 majority, called on Moore to drop out of the race “if these allegations are true.” Several other Republicans, including Texas Senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, and Utah Senator Mike Lee, all of whom endorsed Moore, echoed that sentiment. At least two Republican senators, John McCain of Arizona and John Thune of South Dakota, said Moore should step aside immediately, with McCain calling the accusations “deeply disturbing and disqualifying.” Leigh Corfman, now 53, told the Post she met Moore at a courthouse in 1979 when Moore offered to keep her company on a bench outside of a hearing room while her mother was inside for child custody proceeding. Moore, at the time an assistant district attorney, asked for the girl’s phone number and days later took her to his house, where they engaged in sexual activity before she asked to be taken home, Corfman said. The story also quoted three other women who said Moore dated them when they were between 16 and 18 years of age and he was in his early 30s, though none said they had sexual contact with Moore. Reuters was unable to independently confirm the allegations. The Moore campaign accused the Post of colluding with Democrats to tarnish his reputation with false accusations. The Post said none of the women had donated to or worked for Moore’s Democratic opponent, Doug Jones, or for his Republican primary rivals, and that Corfman said she had voted for Republicans in the past three presidential elections, including for Donald Trump in 2016. Moore has consistently led in polls over Jones. He was considered a heavy favorite in deeply Republican Alabama in the Dec. 12 special election to fill the seat of U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions. It remains to be see whether Thursday’s allegations can buoy Jones’ long-shot bid, which would represent a major upset for Democrats and narrow Republicans’ current edge in the Senate. Jones’ campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Post story. No matter what happens, Moore will remain on the ballot on Dec. 12 since a candidate’s name cannot be removed within 76 days of the election, according to the office of Alabama’s secretary of state. If, however, the state party tells election officials that it wants to withdraw its nominee, or if Moore himself decided to do so, election officials would not certify any votes cast for Moore. Write-in candidates are also allowed under state law. Alabama political strategist David Mowery, who has worked for candidates of both parties, said the chance of Moore bowing out of the race was “less than zero,” and that it was almost as improbable for state party officials to abandon him in favor of a last-minute write-in candidate. Mowery cited Moore’s overwhelming popularity with Alabama’s Republican voters, who he said would tend to distrust allegations published in the Post. Nevertheless, he said Democrats would seize on the scandal to boost fund-raising. Moore, who has made his moral and religious beliefs the heart of his pitch to voters, prevailed over several Republican opponents in a closely contested primary that saw Trump, McConnell and most Senate Republicans support the incumbent who had been appointed to Sessions’ seat, Luther Strange. The race exposed rifts between the Republican Party’s conservative base and its Washington-based establishment. Moore’s candidacy was heavily promoted by former Trump strategist Steve Bannon, who has vowed to support grassroots challengers next year to take on Republican incumbents. On several occasions, Moore has made controversial statements and taken positions that have cost him his job. He has condemned homosexuality and said he believes some U.S. communities are living under Islamic religious law. He first became a national figure in the early 2000s, when he lost his position as Alabama chief justice after refusing a court order to remove a Ten Commandments monument from outside the courthouse. After winning his position back in 2012, he was again forced out after defying the U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing gay marriage by ordering probate judges not to give marriage licenses to same-sex couples. On his Senate campaign website, Moore said he was suspended “for upholding the sanctity of marriage as between one man and one woman.”",1,fakenewsnet,,Republican Senate candidate Moore hit by sexual misconduct allegations

since we were children we have been bombarded with propaganda that romantic love is the ultimate relationship ideal hollywood movies disney cartoons and literary fiction all portray romantic love as an absolute necessity in any wedding union but how much of that narrative has been a lie is it possible that our pursuit of romantic love is actually preventing us from forming a lifelong pair bond i began to question the notion of romantic love when thinking about its emotional root love is a fleeting emotion and like all emotions it comes and goes like the clouds in the sky why have i been taught to select my life partner based on an emotion im surely not encouraged to use emotion when buying a house applying for a job or doing my personal finances but when it comes to choosing a human being that im supposed to spend the rest of my life with im advised by the establishment narrative to use emotion for the biggest decision of them all another major clue that romantic love is a childish strategy for choosing mates is the fact that countries with arranged marriages where partners are picked based on purely practical matters have lower divorce rates that in countries where romantic love is used to select mates while there are multiple reasons for divorce in any society it is rather coincidental that the countries most impacted by notions of romantic love happen to have the highest divorce rates romance was invented it turns out that your desire to use love as a precondition for marriage or pair bonding is an invented construct that had roots in destroying tradition and theistic authority romanticism a movement that began in the th century put romantic love at the forefront not just for individuals but nations as well all from a central thesis of individualism it wanted you to take the focus away from boring old rules and traditions to focusing on how you feel the movement came primarily from bourgeois youth who used family money to fiddle away on idealistic writings the romantic movement was nothing more than a protest against bourgeois conventions bourgeois society and morality to be extreme and flamboyant and unusual and violent even at the risk of becoming grotesque was the desire of every young romantic the romantics were in fact bourgeois origins who were trying hard to escape from their own shadows source romantics believed that men and women ought to be guided by warm emotions rather than the cold abstract rules and rituals established by bourgeois society source they sound a lot like modern day social justice warriors many of whom are trust fund babies that lash out against privilege and inequality to relieve the psychological pain of being wealthy without having had to earn it combined with the fact that sjws also trump feelings over logic its clear to see how romanticists were protosjws whose individualistic ideas are just what the enlightenment needed to complete its destruction of tradition romantics redefined what relationships should be based on prior to the romantic era companionate love was the relationship form often described in literature and other historical writings passionate love is the arousaldriven emotion which often gives people extreme feelings of happiness and can also give people feelings of anguish companionate love is the form which creates a steadfast bond between two people and gives people feelings of peace scientists have described the stage of passionate love as being on cocaine since during that stage the brain releases the same neurotransmitter dopamine as when cocaine is being used source besides song of songs in the old testament writers were not encouraged to muse endlessly about passionate love and there is zero evidence it was used as the principal factor in forming new marriages but its this passionate love that were told to strive for of feeling like youve been swept up in an exciting whirlwind before publishing the gory details on buzzfeed or in a bestseller like eat pray love authored by a woman who is embarking on her second divorce women of the romantic era played a big part in elevating romantic love and why wouldnt they its much more fun to get swept up in the excitement created by noncommittal alpha male than it does to do arduous daily duties before you husband king and god women were given the chance to pick between excitement or responsibility and we know what they have chosen the works of the romantic era also differed from preceding works in that they spoke to a wider audience partly reflecting the greater distribution of books as costs came down during the period the romantic period saw an increase in female authors and also female readers source the modern era has doubled down on the notion of romantic love jewish psychologist robert sternberg proposed the popular triangular theory of love which is often used today as defining the love ideal this theory has caused immense harm for stating that all three forms of love are needed in equal measure for a successful relationship anyone who takes an introductory psychology course or who reads a pop psychology book will be exposed to this theory and walk away thinking that passion is absolutely required in a relationship if its not there the presumption is that the relationship is no longer consummate and far short of ideal believing that romantic love and passion are necessary in a marriage makes it that much easier to exit out of it because when a woman no longer feels passion she will walk away knowing that experts like sternberg would agree that the relationship degraded and was no longer worth saving and this is exactly what modern women are doing in droves they have shown an appalling disregard for their wedding vows especially upon realizing that they initiate of divorces romanticism and the rise of nationalism if nationalism came out of the romantic era and passionate love was a mistake does that mean nationalism is also a mistake one of romanticisms key ideas and most enduring legacies is the assertion of nationalism which became a central theme of romantic art and political philosophy from the earliest parts of the movement with their focus on development of national languages and folklore and the importance of local customs and traditions to the movements that would redraw the map of europe and lead to calls for selfdetermination of nationalities nationalism was one of the key vehicles of romanticism its role expression and meaning patriotism nationalism revolution and armed struggle for independence also became popular themes in the arts of this period source upon closer inspection its easy to see that the ruling agenda of today globalism is essentially world nationalism instead of loving your neighbor and only those who share your unique traditions or race youre supposed to love everyone in the world because its evil to think that there are large differences between a german businessman in a hugo boss suit and a tutsi villager with a lip plate the size of a grapefruit the romantic ideal of nationalism is not adolph hitler but george soros who insists on loving everyone in the world from the depths of your heartfelt human compassion a nationalism based on genetics and local bonds will no doubt serve citizens better than a global nationalism where youre supposed to care for those who are nothing like you how should men choose their life partners its clear that using romantic love and passion as your primary standard for longterm relationships will lead to failure and maybe even personal catastrophe youll easily come to this conclusion by evaluating your past relationships and the mistakes youve made on women who you had intense passion for instead practicality must be the order of the day you must logically evaluate any woman you intend to be with for more than a casual relationship by weighing her values beliefs and sexual history this is easier said than done because weve been so brainwashed to believe passion is important but it simply makes the most amount of sense find a woman the same way you would find a new job or buy a new house and be wary of women who picked you based more on passion than practical matters it may sound cold to search for your wife like you would a business partner but that is exactly what she is the daytoday life of a family home is far more business and economics than love and so you should come to the easy conclusion that thats what you must use to form a stable home understand however that we do not live in a traditional and patriarchal society that aids us in our search for a virtuous woman instead society is encouraging women to corrupt themselves sexually and physically in the name of empowerment and independence making our search exceedingly difficult this is one of the costs we have to pay for living in the modern world some men will be able to overcome it but many men wont and will fail in their search for a woman they can create a family with but at least we are now armed with the knowledge of what it takes to have a more successful longterm relationship its not romantic love or butterflies in the stomach but a matter of practicality logically evaluate her past her values and her beliefs to make sound predictions of how shell behave in the future from this evaluation will come a logical decision that is likely to endure instead of relying on emotion which changes as readily as the direction of the wind read more unconditional love from a woman is impossible,1,fakenewsnet,,how the

"BISMARCK, N.D. (Reuters) - Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, promised on Thursday to roll back some of America’s most ambitious environmental policies, actions that he said would revive the ailing U.S. oil and coal industries and bolster national security. Among the proposals, Trump said he would pull the United States out of the U.N. global climate accord, approve the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada and rescind measures by President Barack Obama to cut U.S. emissions and protect waterways from industrial pollution. “Any regulation that’s outdated, unnecessary, bad for workers or contrary to the national interest will be scrapped and scrapped completely,” Trump told about 7,700 people at the Williston Basin Petroleum Conference in Bismarck, the capital of oil-rich North Dakota. “We’re going to do all this while taking proper regard for rational environmental concerns.” It was Trump’s first speech detailing the energy policies he would advance if elected president. He received loud applause from the crowd of oil executives. The comments painted a stark contrast between the New York billionaire and his Democratic rivals for the White House, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, who advocate a sharp turn away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy technologies to combat climate change. Trump slammed both rivals in his speech, saying their policies would kill jobs and force the United States “to be begging for oil again” from Middle East producers. “It’s not going to happen. Not with me,” he said. Trump’s comments drew quick criticism from environmental advocates, who called his proposals “frightening.” “Trump’s energy policies would accelerate climate change, protect corporate polluters who profit from poisoning our air and water, and block the transition to clean energy that is necessary to strengthen our economy and protect our climate and health,” said Tom Steyer, a billionaire environmental activist. But industry executives cheered the stance. “It’s simple. If Trump wins, oil field workers will be happy. If Clinton wins, oil workers will be unhappy,” said Derrick Alexander, an operations manager at oilfield services firm Integrated Productions Services. Trump hit Clinton hard in his speech, saying the former secretary of state would be more aggressive than Obama on regulations. He repeated several times Clinton’s March comments that her policies would put coal miners out of work. “Hillary Clinton’s agenda is job destruction,” Trump said. Trump said slashing regulation would help the United States achieve energy independence and reduce America’s reliance on Middle Eastern producers. “Imagine a world in which oil cartels will no longer use energy as a weapon,” he said. The United States currently produces about 55 percent of the oil it uses, with another quarter of the total coming from Canada and Mexico, and less than 20 percent coming from OPEC, according to U.S. Energy Department statistics. Trump’s advisers, including U.S. Representative Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, have said they suggested Trump examine the role of OPEC in the global oil price slump since 2014, which has contributed to the demise of a handful of smaller U.S. oil companies. Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members have declined to cut production to support prices. Until Thursday, Trump had been short on details of his energy policy. He has said he believes global warming is a hoax, that his administration would revive the U.S. coal industry, and that he supports hydraulic fracturing - an environmentally controversial drilling technique that has triggered a boom in U.S. production. Earlier this month, he told Reuters in an interview that he would renegotiate “at a minimum” the U.N. global climate accord agreed by 195 countries in Paris last December, saying he viewed the deal as bad for U.S. business. He took that a step further in North Dakota. “We’re going to cancel the Paris climate agreement,” he said. Trump also promised he would invite Canadian pipeline company TransCanada (TRP.TO) to reapply to build the Keystone XL pipeline into the United States, reversing a decision by Obama to block the project over environmental concerns. “I want it built, but I want a piece of the profits,” Trump said. “That’s how we’re going to make our country rich again.” Trump’s pledge briefly sent TransCanada’s shares 29 Canadian cents higher to C$54.13 on the Toronto Stock Exchange, but the stock quickly leveled back off and close up 2 Canadian cents at C$53.86. In response to Trump’s promise that he would seek more profits from the pipeline, TransCanada spokesman James Millar noted the project would create jobs, offer major contracts to U.S. suppliers and provide tens of millions in taxes for state coffers. “The pipeline will benefit American workers longer term as the companies they work for have signed contracts to ship and refine oil through Keystone XL,” Millar said in an email.",1,fakenewsnet,,Trump vows to undo Obama's climate agenda in appeal to oil sector

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The campaign of Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton on Wednesday called support from a broad coalition of voters - including people of color, women and union households - “critical” for anyone hoping to secure the party’s nomination for the November 2016 election and beyond. Robby Mook, Clinton’s campaign manager, noted support for the former secretary of state among African Americans, Latinos and Asian American Pacific Islanders, women and union households in a memo sent out by the campaign. He also noted that Clinton won white voters in the nominating contests for several states on Super Tuesday, the previous day, in which Clinton won seven states to the four states captured by her rival, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. “It is also important to note that these constituencies are not only critical to winning the Democratic nomination but will also be central to how a Democrat wins in November, and a candidate that starts with a deep base of support will have an advantage in the general election,” Mook wrote.

"BERLIN (Reuters) - German rail operator Deutsche Bahn is facing a siege of online criticism over a proposal to name a high-speed train after Holocaust victim Anne Frank, who was deported by train to the Auschwitz concentration camp. The idea to name the high-speed ICE 4 train after Frank came from proposals made by Deutsche Bahn customers and the German public, which a panel reviewed. Of 19,400 submissions, Anne Frank was one of the most popular names, it said. Aware of the historical responsibility we bear, we made a deliberate decision to help keep Anne Frank s memory alive, Bahn said in a statement. It was not our intention to disrespect the memory of Anne Frank in any way whatsoever. Critics say the plan was insensitive. Frank was deported from her home in Amsterdam and taken to Auschwitz by train in September 1944. She was later moved the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where she died in early 1945. Iris Eberl, a conservative Bavarian lawmaker, said on twitter the plan was disrespectful. Mirjam Wenzel, director of the Jewish Museum in Frankfurt, where Frank was born, tweeted that the idea was based on historical amnesia . The Anne Frank House, the museum that preserves the family s hiding place in Amsterdam, said in a statement that the idea of naming the train after her is painful for the people who experienced these deportations, and causes fresh pain to those who still bear the consequences of those times within them.",1,fakenewsnet,,German railway under fire for proposal to name train 'Anne Frank'

"Mitch McConnell pretended to care about the American people on Tuesday as he blamed Democrats for his own party s failure to pass Trumpcare.Seriously. He actually had the gall to accuse Democrats of not caring about people even though the repeal and replace bill his party tried to pass would have stripped healthcare away from millions of Americans and would have gutted Medicaid all while erasing the protections provided by the Affordable Care Act. He even made the outrageous claim that Republicans reached out to Democrats to work with them on the bill. I imagine many Democrats were celebrating last night, McConnell said during a speech on the Senate floor. I hope they consider what they re celebrating. The American people are hurting, they need relief, and it s regretful that our Democratic colleagues decided early on that they did not want to engage with us seriously in the process to deliver that relief. These are not just numbers on a page these are real people, he continued.Except that Republicans never asked Democrats to work with them. Republicans wrote the destructive bill all by themselves and they demanded that Democrats vote blindly in favor of it.As we all know, Democrats told Republicans to go f*ck themselves. And even some Republicans refused to support the bill because it was that bad. Many Republicans faced massive opposition from their own constituents at town halls over the bill.And if Republicans really cared about real people, they would have drafted a bill that doesn t kick over 20 million real people off of their health insurance. It s that simple.But McConnell wants to blame Democrats and pretend that his party cares about people. That doesn t jive considering that Republicans tried killing Obamacare mostly because they wanted to give a fat tax gift to the wealthy at the expense of real people who would not be able to afford healthcare without Obamacare. I regret that the effort to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare will not be successful, McConnell said. That doesn t mean we should give up. We will now try a different way to bring the American people relief from Obamacare. That plan is not exactly different either. It s a 2015 GOP plan that would make premiums skyrocket and strip healthcare from even MORE Americans.Here s the video via YouTube.Twitter users were quick to take McConnell to the woodshed.I just listened to you blaming #Democrats for this. #Liar.

"VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis condemned on Thursday inequality in healthcare, particularly in rich countries, saying governments had a duty to ensure the common good for all its citizens. Increasingly sophisticated and costly treatments are available to ever more limited and privileged segments of the population, Francis said in an address to a conference of European members of the World Medical Association. This raises questions about the sustainability of healthcare delivery and about what might be called a systemic tendency toward growing inequality in healthcare, he said. The tendency was clearly apparent when you compared healthcare cover between countries and continents, the pope said, adding that it was also visible within more wealthy countries, where access to healthcare risks being more dependent on individuals economic resources than on their actual need for treatment. Francis did not mention any countries. Healthcare is a big issue in the United States, where President Donald Trump has vowed to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, introduced by his predecessor, Barack Obama, which aimed to make it easier for lower-income households to get health insurance. He said healthcare legislation needed a broad vision and a comprehensive view of what most effectively promotes the common good in each concrete situation. In speaking of end-of-life issues, Francis re-affirmed the Catholic Church s long-standing teaching that it is morally acceptable for a patient or a family to suspend or reject disproportionate measures to keep a terminally ill person alive. But he stressed that this was different from euthanasia, which is always wrong, in that the intent of euthanasia is to end life and cause death . Regarding end-of-life decisions, the pope said governments had a duty to protect all those involved, defending the fundamental equality whereby everyone is recognized under law as a human being living with others in society .",1,fakenewsnet,,Pope denounces healthcare inequality in rich countries
"(Reuters) - Myanmar has accused Reuters reporters Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27, of breaching the country s Official Secrets Act, a little-used hangover from colonial rule. Sam Zarifi, secretary general of the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ), said the law can ensnare working journalists at any time . The two reporters were arrested on Tuesday evening after they were invited to meet police officers for dinner in the north of Yangon. The Ministry of Information said they had illegally acquired information with the intention to share it with foreign media , and published a photo of the pair in handcuffs standing behind a table with documents laid on it. The law dates back to 1923, when Myanmar, then known as Burma, was a province of British India. At the time British administrators worried that rival powers could seek to exploit anti-colonial unrest in its South Asian empire. The act, which amended earlier anti-spying legislation, was controversial in India even at the time, according to a history published in 2009 by the United Service Institution of India, a New Delhi-based think tank. British military officers pushed for the stronger law over concerns about an increase in Bolshevik activity , along with geopolitical threats including the possibility of racial war between Japan and the USA affecting India , the history said. The Official Secrets Act covers trespassing in prohibited areas, handling documents deemed secret and communicating with foreign agents . It carries a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison. Zarifi of the Geneva-based ICJ - a human rights group made up of 60 senior international judges, lawyers and legal academics - said the definition of an official secret in the act is incredibly broad . Just about anyone in possession of unpublished government documents could find themselves facing prosecution and the harsh penalties a conviction may carry, Zarifi said. Under this law many good journalists could be prosecuted at any time. In India, where the same law also remains on the statute book, courts have ruled that it even applies to parliamentary papers such as budget proposals if they are leaked before they are presented in the legislature. Legal experts say prosecutions under the act have been rare in Myanmar in recent decades. The military junta that ruled until 2011 frequently used other laws or the Penal Code - also inherited from the colonial era - to lock up its critics alongside common criminals. The sprawling code was drafted in 1860, and gives magistrates more than 500 sections under which to charge alleged offenders. In 1990, a military court sentenced two leaders of the then opposition National League for Democracy (NLD) to 10 years in prison under the Official Secrets Act after they passed an official letter to foreign embassies. The prosecution was part of a broad crackdown following an election won by the NLD that the junta ignored. They were freed in 1992, in an amnesty, according to a New York Times report at the time. Reports of at least two other cases brought under the act are recorded in the online archives of the Asian Human Rights Commission in 2009 and 2010. The first case involved a man jailed for trespassing on military land and recording video footage to allegedly send abroad. He had been helping a farmer file a land grab complaint against the military. The second concerned a former army officer who was jailed in 2010 for allegedly having secret information on his laptop that he passed to foreign news agencies. The most well-documented recent case involving the Official Secrets Act came in January of 2014, when the Yangon-based weekly, Unity Journal, published a front page article it said exposed a secret chemical weapons factory run by the military in central Myanmar. Police arrested the newspaper s CEO and four journalists involved in publishing the story, raided its offices, and attempted to seize all copies of the edition from newsstands. A civilian court in Pakkoku, near the alleged factory, sentenced them in July 2014 to 10 years in prison with hard labor - later reduced to seven years. The case was widely seen by the domestic media as a warning that military affairs remained off-limits even though direct military rule had ended. The Unity Five were released in an amnesty in April 2016, soon after the NLD, led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, had come to power following an election in 2015. The Unity Journal subsequently closed. Reuters was unable to reach government legal officials over the weekend and a Monday public holiday to request details of any other past cases in which the Official Secrets Act was used. Little is known of the allegations against the two Reuters journalists, other than that police said they were arrested for possessing important and secret government documents related to Rakhine State and security forces and are charged under Section 3 of the Official Secrets Act. Two policemen are also being investigated in the case, according to police. Section 3 covers entering prohibited places, taking images or handling secret official documents that might be or is intended to be, directly or indirectly, useful to an enemy . Human Rights Watch in 2016 said Section 3 defines the offence of spying extremely broadly . Where a military establishment is involved, section 3(2) of the statute effectively places the burden on the defendant to prove that they are not guilty, the group said. In May 2016, the month after Suu Kyi took power, the 1975 State Protection Act that had been used to keep her under house arrest for years was repealed. The Emergency Provisions Act, introduced in 1950 and frequently used against activists after the military seized power in a 1962 coup, was swept away in October the same year. But the Official Secrets Act and other laws, such as the 1908 Unlawful Associations Act, that have been used to jail journalists and activists, remain in force. Reuters was unable to reach Suu Kyi s spokesman to seek comment from Suu Kyi on the use of the Official Secrets Act to detain the two Reuters journalists.",1,fakenewsnet,,Explainer: Myanmar wields colonial-era law against Reuters journalists

"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers on Thursday began coalescing around revised bipartisan legislation to help address Puerto Rico’s unpayable debt burden, which now threatens a full-blown humanitarian crisis. Released close to midnight on Wednesday, the House Natural Resources Committee’s revised bill includes a strong oversight board to direct how and when the island pays its bills and leaves many earlier proposals in place. Puerto Rico has already defaulted on some of its roughly $70 billion in debt while trying to cope with a 45 percent poverty rate among its 3.5 million U.S. citizens. In addition, it is reeling from a Zika virus outbreak that is hurting its critical tourism industry. Language allowing Puerto Rico to cut repayments to creditors without their consent, known as a “cram-down,” remains. The bill does not prioritize pensioners over bondholders, but the language remains muddied, one analyst surmised. “Tonight, we introduced legislation to responsibly address the crisis in Puerto Rico. The revised bill incorporates technical refinements and input from all stakeholders,” committee Chairman Rob Bishop said in a statement. For a link to a factbox on the bill, click. While both Republican and Democratic leaders of the U.S. House of Representatives welcomed the bill after several delays, how more conservative Republican lawmakers view the legislation is an open question. A vote on the bill by the House is expected in the first week of June, ahead of a looming $1.9 billion debt payment due on July 1. In recent months, the debt crisis has threatened a deepening humanitarian crisis as hospitals close wards, social services decline and emigration saps more economic activity. “After long bipartisan negotiations, we believe we have achieved a restructuring process that can work,” U.S. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement on Thursday. House Speaker Paul Ryan, who faces opposition to the bill from within his own Republican ranks, highlighted the bipartisan effort as he will need Democrat votes to get it passed. “Right now, the stability of the U.S. territory is in danger, as the Puerto Rican government continues to default on major loan payments. We have insisted that our response meet basic principles, and first among them is protecting taxpayers from a bailout,” Ryan said in a statement. The bill, formally known as the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA), seeks to return the island to solvency, rebuild a base for economic growth and maintain its ability to access capital markets in the future. The White House called the bill an “important first step” in creating a fair process for restructuring Puerto Rico’s debt and economy after a decade of recession. The U.S. territory’s governor, Alejandro Garcia Padilla, said he was encouraged by the bill but chafed at the oversight board, which he believes undermine the island’s self-governance. Choosing the members of the oversight board has been a sticking point in the talks leading up to the introduction of the bill. U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said on Thursday he was pleased the bill includes “restructuring tools for Puerto Rico that are comprehensive and workable” but expressed disappointment that proposals to promote economic growth were left out of what he called a “tough bipartisan compromise.” In the early drafts of the bill, Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, the chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee, said he was not satisfied, meaning a potential hurdle for passing the bill could remain. A conservative Tea Party favorite, Representative Raul Labrador of Idaho, said he was reviewing the bill but told Reuters he thought a majority of Republicans would “support it through both houses of Congress.” Many creditors lobbied for a bill that does not create new precedents for how they might be treated in a restructuring which would potentially set up future legal fights on the U.S. mainland that are far away from the island’s current crisis. “The bill, which creates a control board and allows for bankruptcy, is highly controversial and does not definitively protect any creditors. We believe the legislation is more positive for both GO and COFINA creditors than the legislation previously under review,” wrote Heights Securities analyst Daniel Hanson. Hanson said the bill lacks clarity over the treatment of constitutionally protected bondholders versus pensioners. A local bondholder group said it supported the bill. “As imperfect as it may be, the bipartisan bill is the ‘pause’ that is desperately needed so everyone can come together to forge a bright future for all Americans living in Puerto Rico,” said Jorge Irizarry, president of the Backyard Bondholders, which represents more than 60,000 resident bondholders in Puerto Rico. GO, or General Obligation bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the island and are senior to all debt, while COFINA debt is backed by sales tax revenues. “This territories-clause bill, which will bring all creditors to the table and establish a strong and independent fiscal oversight board, should appeal to conservatives who were concerned about a ‘bailout’ or ‘contagion,’” the COFINA Senior Bondholders Ad Hoc Group said in a statement. Investors bid up prices on Puerto Rico’s benchmark July 2035 GO debt to 66, a gain of 0.50 point in price to yield 12.797 percent, according to MSRB data.",1,fakenewsnet,,"Bipartisan Puerto Rico crisis bill introduced, debt looms"

"SEOUL (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump may travel to the heavily fortified demilitarized zone (DMZ) separating North and South Korea when he visits South Korea next month, the South s Yonhap news agency said on Tuesday, citing a defense source. The White House sent an advance team of working-level officials in late September to check candidate sites for Trump s special activity in South Korea, the source was quoted as saying. Trump was expected to send a significant message to North Korea, either verbally or kinetically , during his first trip to the peninsula as U.S. commander-in-chief, the source said. The truce village of Panmunjom and the observation post, both inside the DMZ, were among locations Trump was considering visiting, the source said. Yonhap did not elaborate and the White House did not comment. Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un have been engaged in an increasingly bellicose exchange of rhetoric, with Trump suggesting the military option was the only way to halt the North s missile and nuclear programs. A trip to the DMZ, following in the footsteps of his predecessor, Barack Obama, and Vice President Mike Pence, would bring Trump within yards of North Korean soldiers, who stand eyeball to eyeball with their South Korean enemies, and likely be regarded by the North as highly provocative. In recent weeks, North Korea has launched two missiles over Japan and conducted its sixth nuclear test, all in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions, and may be fast advancing toward its well publicized goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland. Trump repeatedly has made clear his distaste for dialogue with North Korea. Last week, he dismissed the idea of talks as a waste of time, a day after Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Washington was maintaining open lines of communication with Kim Jong Un s government. Our country has been unsuccessfully dealing with North Korea for 25 years, giving billions of dollars & getting nothing. Policy didn t work! the U.S. president said in a Twitter post on Monday. Reclusive North Korea and the rich, democratic South are technically still at war because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.

"TOKYO (Reuters) - The escalating threat from North Korea’s nuclear program shows a clear need for a “new approach,” U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Thursday, although he did not say what the Trump administration planned. It was the first time that Tillerson, who was speaking at a joint news conference in Tokyo after talks with Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida, had taken questions from the media since taking office in early February. Two decades of diplomatic and other efforts, including U.S. aid for North Korea, had failed to achieve the goal of denuclearizing Pyongyang, said Tillerson, a former oil executive with no prior diplomatic experience, at the start of his first trip to Asia as secretary of state. “So we have 20 years of failed approach,” Tillerson said. “That includes a period where the United States has provided $1.35 billion in assistance to North Korea as an encouragement to take a different pathway.” “In the face of this ever-escalating threat, it is clear that a different approach is required. Part of the purpose of my visit to the region is to exchange views on a new approach,” he said. A Japanese foreign ministry official said U.S. officials had discussed potential new approaches regarding North Korea, but he declined to elaborate. As Tillerson presses the Chinese to do more to rein in North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs, he is expected to tell them the United States intends to increase missile defense in the region, despite Beijing’s strong opposition, a U.S. official told Reuters in Washington. An advanced U.S. anti-missile system is being installed in South Korea, and the official said the Trump administration wants to discuss similar improvements with Japan. Tillerson visits South Korea and China later in the week. Tillerson is also likely to raise the prospects for imposing “secondary sanctions” on Chinese banks and other firms doing business with North Korea, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. It is among the options being considered in a full review of North Korea policy expected to be completed by late March or early April, the official said.State Department spokesman Mark Toner said on Wednesday Tillerson will have “substantive, hard” talks on next steps in dealing with North Korea but that his visit was not likely to produce an immediate specific response. In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying repeated Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s proposal last week that North Korea should stop its nuclear and missile tests and South Korea and the United States should stop joint military drills and seek talks instead. “We welcome all parties, including the United States, to come up with their own proposals,” Hua told a daily news briefing. “As long as these proposals are conducive to ameliorating the present tense situation on the Korean peninsula and are beneficial to maintaining regional peace and stability ... China will have an open attitude.” Tillerson made it clear he expected China, North Korea’s sole major ally, to do more. “We will be having discussions with China as to further actions we believe they might consider taking that would be helpful to bringing North Korea to a different attitude about its future need for nuclear weapons,” he said. Tillerson’s comments in Japan were eagerly watched by international observers for indications as to what they meant for the Trump administration’s foreign policy. Japan is seeking clues to Washington’s policies both on North Korea and China’s increasing military and economic clout while hoping to steer clear of trade rows. Tillerson also held talks with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and had dinner with Kishida. U.S. President Donald Trump made it a hallmark of his campaign to call on allies, including Japan, to pay more for hosting U.S. forces and other elements of American protection. Tillerson issued a far gentler message at the conference, underscoring the “long-standing” U.S.-Japanese alliance. “While the security environment in this region can be challenging, the United States is committed to strengthening our role, and we welcome an increased Japanese commitment to their roles and responsibilities in our alliance,” he said. Tillerson is the second member of Trump’s cabinet to visit Japan. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis visited last month, and Vice President Mike Pence is due in April, underscoring U.S. concerns surrounding North Korea’s missile and nuclear programs. Abe was the first foreign leader who met Trump after his November election win. North Korea last week launched four ballistic missiles, the latest in a series, and is developing nuclear-tipped missiles that can reach the United States, in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions and sanctions. Washington has said all options, including military, are on the table in its review of policies toward North Korea. In the final months of the Obama administration, U.S. officials warned it would blacklist Chinese companies and banks that do illicit business with North Korea if Beijing failed to enforce U.N. sanctions against Pyongyang. The United States has begun deploying the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile defense system in South Korea, a move China objects to strongly because it sees the system’s radar as a threat to its security. Pak Myong Ho, a North Korean embassy official speaking in Beijing on Thursday, said the deployment “will destroy the balance in Northeast Asia and the Pacific region.” “The radar is not aimed at just us,” Pak said. “It is also aiming for China and Russia.” China’s assertiveness in the East China Sea, where it has a territorial row with Japan, and the South China Sea, where it has disputes with the Philippines and several other Southeast Asian nations, were also on the agenda.",1,fakenewsnet,,"Tillerson urges 'new approach' to North Korea, gives no details"
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two minor tremors were detected on Saturday from near North Korea s nuclear test site and were probably aftershocks from the country s massive nuclear test in early September, a U.S. Geological Survey official said. The aftershocks, of magnitude 2.9 and 2.4, were detected at 0613 and 0640 GMT (1:13 a.m. and 1:40 a.m. EST) respectively, said the USGS and Lassina Zerbo, executive secretary of the Vienna-based Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization. A tweet from Zerbo said analysts had confirmed that the activity was tectonic in origin. The USGS official said the tremors had been in the vicinity of the Punggye-ri nuclear test site, where North Korea conducted its sixth and largest underground nuclear test on Sept. 3. They re probably relaxation events from the sixth nuclear test, the official said. When you have a large nuclear test, it moves the earth s crust around the area, and it takes a while for it to fully subside. We ve had a few of them since the sixth nuclear test. Pyongyang said the September test was of an H-bomb, and experts have estimated it was 10 times more powerful than the U.S. atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945. A series of quakes since then has prompted experts and observers to suspect the test might have damaged the mountainous location of its site in the northwest tip of North Korea, where all of the country s nuclear tests have been conducted. South Korea s spy agency told South Korean lawmakers in October that North Korea might be readying two more tunnels at the site. North Korea hinted its next nuclear test could be above ground after U.S. President Donald Trump warned in September that the United States would totally destroy North Korea if it threatened America. Another possible obstacle to North Korea s use of Punggye-ri for tests is the nearby active volcano of Mount Paektu, which North Koreans consider a sacred site. Its last eruption was in 1903, and experts have debated whether nuclear testing could trigger another. North Korea s official media reported on Saturday that national leader Kim Jong Un had scaled Mount Paektu with senior military officials to emphasize his military vision after completion of the country s nuclear force. Kim declared the nuclear force complete after the test of North Korea s largest ever intercontinental ballistic missile last month, which experts said puts all of America within range.",1,fakenewsnet,,Aftershocks likely from September test detected from North Korea nuclear site: USGS

"Shark Tank star and insanely successful real estate mogul Barbara Corcoran has known Republican nominee Donald Trump for over three decades and she recently showed that there s no one better to drop a truth bomb on America about who The Donald really is.In an epic interview with Erin Burnett, Corcoran added more weight to the allegations of the twelve women who have come forward against Trump, claiming that the business mogul sexually assaulted them. Corcoran admitted that she saw inappropriate behavior from Trump quite often, and she was even the victim of his misogynistic, degrading behavior at one point in time.Corcoran admitted that when she was pregnant, Trump began talking excessively about her breasts while they were in a business meeting. Corcoran recalled the time Trump sexualized and objectified her: I was pregnant with my first child at the time. So was his second wife [Marla Maples]. And he compared my breast size to his wife by putting his hands in the air, telling me how large they are. If a man is that way so inappropriate I just assume it s that way all the time. Corcoran showed solidarity with Trump s victims and not only said that she believed them, but said she thought it was preposterous that he s claiming he s done nothing like that. The popular investor also said she hoped she was wrong about her earlier prediction that Trump might win the election, noting that she thinks he will self-destruct before he gets any closer to the White House.You can watch Corcoran blow the lid off Trump s lies below:Corcoran is now the second Shark Tank investor to rail against Trump, following billionaire Mark Cuban, who has been destroying Trump every chance he gets for the last several weeks.Featured image via Frederick M.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Obama administration signed its final plan for renewable fuel use in the United States last week, leaving an oil industry reeling from the most aggressive biofuel targets yet as President-elect Donald Trump takes over. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program, signed into law by President George W. Bush, is one of the country’s most controversial energy policies. It requires energy firms to blend ethanol and biodiesel into gasoline and diesel. The policy was designed to cut greenhouse gas emissions, reduce U.S. reliance on oil imports and boost rural economies that provide the crops for biofuels. It has pitted two of Trump’s support bases against each other: Big Oil and Big Corn. The farming sector has lobbied hard for the maximum biofuel volumes laid out in the law to be blended into gasoline motor fuels, while the oil industry argues that the program creates additional costs. Balancing oil and farm interests is likely to prove a challenge for Trump, who has promised to curtail regulations on the oil industry but is already being reminded by biofuels advocates of the importance of the program to the American Midwest, where he received strong support from voters on Nov. 8. Oil groups are renewing their calls to change or repeal the program following Wednesday’s announcement, when the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) set record mandates for renewable fuels - for the first time hitting levels targeted by Congress nearly a decade ago.. The EPA plan is “completely detached from market realities and confirms once again that Congress must take immediate action to remedy this broken program,” said Chet Thompson, President of the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, in a statement. It is unclear what Trump’s plans for the program will be and his transition team did not respond to Reuters’ requests for comment. Both camps are expecting an administration receptive to their demands, though both have expressed concern and uncertainty over Trump’s plans for the program, according to experts, industry and political sources. The installation of climate change skeptic Myron Ebell as head of the transition at the EPA bolstered oil industry confidence Trump will swing their way. In September, Trump appeared to briefly echo the views of his supporter, billionaire Carl Icahn, who expressed concern about the program. Icahn, who owns a stake in an oil refiner, renewed those criticisms last week, saying the ethanol credit market generated by the program is susceptible to manipulation and harming independent refiners. PRO-ETHANOL CAMPAIGNING The president-elect campaigned on a pro-ethanol platform when he visited America’s farm states and biofuels advocates expect he will keep the RFS strong, maintaining annual targets at the minimum set forth by Congress. “Mr. Trump will not turn his back on the American heartland, we believe in him,” said Annette Sweeney, a former state representative from Iowa who was a member of the Trump’s agricultural advisory committee during his candidacy. “To a certain extent, we are on higher ground. You always want to be on higher ground,” said Bob Dinneen, head of the Renewable Fuels Association, referring to the increase. “We’ll be able to demonstrate the marketplace can absorb 15 billion gallons of ethanol. We can put this all behind us. As we look to 2018... there’s no reason to go back,” he said. The renewables industries have already started to emphasize their place among American-made fuels, something experts expect will appeal to Trump. “There are a lot of good things to be said about second-generation fuels, even from the new administration’s perspective,” said Harvard University professor and former Obama administration advisor James Stock. “All the new administration needs to do is embrace the original ... vision of the RFS,” he said.",1,fakenewsnet,,Trump faces dilemma as U.S. oil reels from record biofuels targets

Today s unanimous Supreme Court decision is a clear victory for our national security, Trump said in a statement. As President, I cannot allow people into our country who want to do us harm. I want people who can love the United States and all of its citizens, and who will be hardworking and productive. He added: My number one responsibility as Commander in Chief is to keep the American people safe. Today s ruling allows me to use an important tool for protecting our Nation s homeland. The court made clear that a limited version of the policy can be enforced immediately with a full hearing to come in the Fall. An American individual or entity that has a bona fide relationship with a particular person seeking to enter the country as a refugee can legitimately claim concrete hardship if that person is excluded, the court wrote. As to these individuals and entities, we do not disturb the injunction. But when it comes to refugees who lack any such connection to the United States, for the reasons we have set out, the balance tips in favor of the Government s compelling need to provide for the Nation s security.

"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump refused to admit that his belief and promotion of the racist and inaccurate birther conspiracy theory was wrong. The candidate doubled down on the false idea that has been promoted by conservatives for almost a decade now in an interview with the Washington Post:In the interview, conducted late Wednesday aboard his private plane as it idled on the tarmac here, Trump suggested he is not eager to change his pitch or his positions even as he works to reach out to minority voters, many of whom are deeply offended by his long-refuted suggestion that Obama is not a U.S. citizen. Trump refused to say whether he believes Obama was born in Hawaii. I ll answer that question at the right time. I just don t want to answer it yet, Trump said.When asked about claims in the media from campaign manager Kellyanne Conway that he is no longer a birther, Trump told the paper, It s okay. She s allowed to speak what she thinks. I want to focus on jobs, I want to focus on other things. He added, I don t talk about it anymore. Trump has been promoting the birther conspiracy since 2011, and has never renounced it in the ensuing 5 years. He is on the verge of 2,000 straight days of supporting the conspiracy.President Barack Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, on August 4, 1961. His birth there has been certified at the federal level when he was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 2004 and when he was elected President of the United States in November 2008.Despite this, as the first black president in U.S. history, conservatives have consistently pushed the idea that Obama is not a natural-born citizen and instead was born in Kenya, where his father is from. The story is completely false, but has been a running theme in conservative politics.Trump was the most prominent and well-known person pushing the conspiracy theory, and even since running for president, has never renounced nor condemned it.Featured image via Flickr",0,fakenewsnet,," Trump Sticks To Racist Birther Conspiracy Theory, Won’t Admit Obama Born In USA"

She asked Santorum how he would advise her to plan for her future.He began his reply by talking about his father, who left Mussolini s Italy to come to the U.S. when he was 7 years old even though, Santorum said, he wasn t allowed to come because of the immigration laws at the time. Then he began to address Vilchis specifically. What most people in America feel is that you ve been given a tremendous benefit by being here in this country, Santorum said, adding that he imagined she wouldn t have had to opportunities to accomplish what you have in her country of origin. My final point is that you have the ability to go to any other country right now and apply those wares, and be successful, and reapply to come back to America, Santorum added.

"Donald Trump really doesn t make sticky situations any better for himself.Trump s entanglements with Russia continue to be a growing story, and a more recent piece to this puzzle came into play as Trump s Attorney General Jeff Sessions was accused of perjury over his communications with Russia. But if Trump was somehow trying to clean up his image and maintain a low profile, the fact that he liked a tweet about Senator Al Franken accusing Sessions of perjury certainly isn t going to help:The fact that Trump would publicly like a story about one of his biggest scandals only proves how insane he is. Every part of the Fox News story that Trump is calling attention to is negative, and portrays Sessions as someone who lied under oath because all of his arguments were so weak. And that s not all the story shows that there was a THIRD time Sessions made contact with Russia, when before only two had been reported.To make this even more bizarre, Trump decided to like this story on the very day a poll was released that revealed most Americans were in agreement that Sessions lied under oath and should resign.Either Trump really thinks he s going to get away with all of this no matter how bold he is, or he s really that stupid. Considering that these actions are coming from the same man that bragged about how he could go out on a popular New York street and shoot someone without losing any votes, he really just might be that confident that he is going to skate by all of these accusations and investigations.

"WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (Reuters) - An adviser to U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s campaign said on Sunday that Trump will meet with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Monday during the United Nations General Assembly, just as Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, is also scheduled to do. Clinton, who faces Trump in the Nov. 8 election, announced last week that she would meet both with Sisi and Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko in bilateral sessions expected to take place late on Monday. A foreign policy advisor to Trump, Walid Phares, told Reuters on Sunday that Trump would also have talks with Sisi on the same day. For Trump, a New York real estate magnate and reality-TV show host who has never held political office, it marks the second time in recent weeks he has tried to burnish his foreign-policy credentials to compete with Clinton, the former Secretary of State under President Barack Obama and a U.S. Senator from New York. Trump ventured to Mexico late last month to meet with President Enrique Pena Nieto to discuss border security between the two nations. But afterward, both sides quickly accused the other of not accurately representing the scope of the conversations, with Trump insisting that the subject of which country would pay for a proposed wall between the two nations never came up, and Pena Nieto saying that his country would never agree to finance it. Egypt remains in flux after the country’s chaotic revolution in 2011 that deposed President Hosni Mubarak, a movement that the Obama administration supported. Then-Secretary Clinton has since written that she advised a more conservative approach than the White House ultimately took toward Mubarak’s exit. Egypt’s Islamist President, Mohamad Morsi, was eventually supplanted by Sisi, the nation’s former defense minister and a secularist, in 2013. Some Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives have since accused the Obama administration of abandoning its support of Egypt’s government in its battle against Islamic militants. Trump has called for aggressive measures in combating the threat of Islamic State forces in Iraq and Syria and has proposed blocking immigrants from countries that he says pose a threat to the United States. Earlier in his campaign, he suggested banning all Muslims from entering the country. Clinton’s meeting with Ukraine President Poroshenko also is likely to be provocative given the reportedly close ties between Trump’s campaign and the administration of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - More than 40 lawmakers urged the Trump administration on Wednesday to reimpose U.S. travel bans on Myanmar’s military leaders and prepare targeted sanctions against those responsible for a crackdown on the country’s Rohingya Muslim minority. In a letter sent to U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, a group of Republican and Democratic members of the House of Representatives called for “meaningful steps” against Myanmar’s military and others who have committed human rights abuses in an offensive that has driven more than 500,000 Rohingya Muslims out of the Southeast Asian nation. “Burma’s authorities appear to be in denial of what has happened,” stated the letter. “We urge you to do everything possible to ensure protection and security for those trapped inside Burma or willing to return, as well as oppose forcible returns from neighboring countries.”",1,fakenewsnet,,Lawmakers urge U.S. to craft targeted sanctions on Myanmar military
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he would not have appointed Jeff Sessions as attorney general if he had known Sessions would recuse himself from the Russia investigation, according to a New York Times interview. “Sessions should have never recused himself and if he was going to recuse himself he should have told me before he took the job and I would have picked somebody else,” the Times quoted Trump as saying. Sessions recused himself in March from the probe into allegations of Russia’s meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and possible ties between Russians and the Trump campaign. He did so after failing to disclose at his confirmation hearing that he had held meetings last year with Russia’s ambassador. A Sessions spokesman declined a Reuters request for comment. There were media reports last month that Sessions, a former U.S. senator who was an early supporter of Trump’s campaign, had offered to resign because of tensions with Trump over the recusal. Trump also told the New York Times that a conversation he had with Russian President Vladimir Putin during a dinner at the Group of 20 summit in Germany earlier this month lasted about 15 minutes and was mostly about “pleasantries.” That conversation has sparked controversy because it was only disclosed on Tuesday. Ian Bremmer, the president of political risk consultancy Eurasia Group, has said the meeting lasted about an hour.",1,fakenewsnet,,Trump says he should not have picked Sessions as attorney general: NY Times

"BOGOTA (Reuters) - Thirteen people, including civilians, were killed during a confrontation between Colombia s ELN rebels and dissidents from the now-demobilized FARC guerrilla group in a remote area known for drug trafficking, the country s ombudsman said on Tuesday. The incident took place on Nov. 27 in the southwestern Narino region, a place where crime gangs and rebel groups are known to grow, process and smuggle coca, the base ingredient in cocaine. A hard-won peace accord was agreed with the now-disbanded Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebel group last year, ending some five decades of war. But an array of FARC dissidents, National Liberation Army (ELN) rebels, right-wing ex-paramilitaries and crime gangs are still active in Colombia, competing for control of lucrative illegal mines and drug trafficking routes. In Narino, fighters from the ELN attacked members of the Rural Resistance, ombudsmen Carlos Alfonso Negret said in a report. The Rural Resistance are FARC dissidents who refused to demobilize following the peace deal. The ombudsman s office visited the area and was able to determine that there was an exchange of fire between the group that calls itself Rural Resistance and the ELN, Negret told journalists. There was crossfire that killed 13 people. Neither the report nor Negret specified how many of the dead were civilians. More than 11,000 fighters and collaborators from the FARC handed over their weapons this year as part of the peace accord. The group has kept its initials in its reincarnation as a political party. But Negret says some 800 former guerrillas did not demobilize, while other security sources and thinktanks put the number of dissident ex-FARC at between 700 and 1,300. The ELN and the government began their first ever bilateral ceasefire in October, part of peace talks taking place in Ecuador. The ceasefire is set to run through Jan. 9 and may be extended. The incident was a violation of the ceasefire, Negret said. It is the second act of violence which has overshadowed the ceasefire, after the ELN admitted to killing an indigenous leader in restive Choco province.",1,fakenewsnet,,"Shoot-out between Colombia rebels kills 13, government says"

"21st Century Wire says It s hard to not to draw a comparison between the Brexit referendum and the stunning surprise victory of Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election in America. Many now argue that both were a repudiation on globalization.Indeed, anxiety over the global economy as a whole contributed to 2016 s historic rejection of the status quo: big trade, big banks and Wall Street.Yesterday in his overseas speech, even President Obama acknowleged that the globalized policies of the world have absolutely contributed to a political upheaval that has given rise to Brexit vote and a Trump presidency: The current path of globalization demands a course correction, adding Any legislation that is proven flawed can be corrected through the process of democracy. Earlier this year, conservative leaning Washington Times discusssed the nature of falied policy that has led to such sluggish growth in the US over the past 7-8 years: The previously bullish Fed finally and openly acknowledged that sluggish growth is the long term new normal for America. Secular stagnation is here to stay. The growth rate has limped out of the 2008-09 recession at a 2 percent pace now for seven years. The Joint Economic Committee of Congress tells us a normal recovery gives us about 3.5 percent growth and the Reagan and JFK booms were closer to 4 percent. So the GDP today thanks to President Obama is about $2 to $3 trillion smaller than it should be. This is roughly the equivalent of losing the entire annual output of every business and worker in Michigan, Ohio and Indiana combined.Instead of speeding up to recover all this lost ground, we re decelerating. Growth was 1.4 percent in the 4th quarter of 2015. It was 0.8 percent in the first quarter of this year. The Fed now has downgraded growth now to less than 2 percent for the rest of 2016 down from an original forecast of 2.4 percent. One day after the US election, The Intercept s Glenn Greenwald (of Snowden fame) captured the frustartion that led to the Brexit vote and Trump s win. Here s a short passage from his piece: The institutions and elite factions that have spent years mocking, maligning, and pillaging large portions of the population all while compiling their own long record of failure and corruption and destruction are now shocked that their dictates and decrees go unheeded. But human beings are not going to follow and obey the exact people they most blame for their suffering. They re going to do exactly the opposite: purposely defy them and try to impose punishment in retaliation. Only time will tell what the future holds for Brexit or Trump but for the moment, the voice of the everyday man has been heard loud and clear.More from Washington s Blog below (Image Source: Onmanorama). Washington s BlogTrumpTrump made rejection of globalization a centerpiece of his campaign. In his July 21st acceptance speech as the Republican nominee, he said:Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo.The Boston Globe bannered this headline on Thursday: Trump won. Globalization lost. Now what? On election night, CNN s Jake Tapper explained that many Americans voted for Trump because they are sick of the income inequality, globalization, and politics-as-usual that the status quo have given us. He pointed out that only a handful of people have gotten rich off of globalization, and a lot of people have been left behind.Counterpunch wrote Friday:The real meaning of this upset is that Wall Street s globalization project has been rejected by the citizens of its homeland.***Trump voters had several reasons to vote for Trump other than racism . Most of all, they want their jobs back, jobs that have vanished thanks to the neoliberal policy of transferring manufacturing jobs to places with low wages.BrexitSimilarly, Brexit was largely a vote against globalization.For example, the Guardian ran an article in June explaining, Brexit is a rejection of globalisation :Britain s rejection of the EU. This was more than a protest against the career opportunities that never knock and the affordable homes that never get built. It was a protest against the economic model that has been in place for the past three decades.***Europe has failed to fulfil the historic role allocated to it. Jobs, living standards and welfare states were all better protected in the heyday of nation states in the 1950s and 1960s than they have been in the age of globalisation. Unemployment across the eurozone is more than 10%. Italy s economy is barely any bigger now than it was when the euro was created. Greece s economy has shrunk by almost a third.***Inevitably, there has been a backlash, manifested in the rise of populist parties on the left and right. An increasing number of voters believe there is not much on offer from the current system. They think globalisation has benefited a small privileged elite, but not them. They think it is unfair that they should pay the price for bankers failings. They hanker after a return to the security that the nation state provided, even if that means curbs on the core freedoms that underpin globalisation, including the free movement of people.***Torsten Bell, the director of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, analysed the voting patterns in the referendum and found that those parts of Britain with the strongest support for Brexit were those that had been poor for a long time. The result was affected by deeply entrenched national geographical inequality , he said.There has been much lazy thinking in the past quarter of a century about globalisation. As Bell notes, it is time to rethink the assumption that a flexible globalised economy can generate prosperity that is widely shared. But What Do the Experts Say?Mainstream economists, organizations and politicians including the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (and see this), McKinsey & Company and Obama now admit that globalization creates inequality. People worldwide are furious at runaway inequality and it s affecting elections globally.The Bank of International Settlements the Central Banks Central Bank says that financial globalization itself makes booms and busts far more frequent and destabilizing than they otherwise would be.The Economist pointed out in July:Most economists have been blindsided by the backlash [against globalization]. A few saw it coming. It is worth studying their reasoning .David Autor, David Dorn and Gordon Hanson have documented how the costs of America s growing trade with China has fallen disproportionately on certain cities. And so on.Branko Milanovic of the City University of New York believes such costs perpetuate a cycle of globalisation. He argues that periods of global integration and technological progress generate rising inequality .Supporters of economic integration underestimated the risks both that big slices of society would feel left behind .The New York Times reported in March:Were the experts wrong about the benefits of trade for the American economy?***Voters anger and frustration, driven in part by relentless globalization and technological change [has made Trump and Sanders popular, and] is already having a big impact on America s future, shaking a once-solid consensus that freer trade is, necessarily, a good thing. The economic populism of the presidential campaign has forced the recognition that expanded trade is a double-edged sword, wrote Jared Bernstein, former economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.What seems most striking is that the angry working class dismissed so often as myopic, unable to understand the economic trade-offs presented by trade appears to have understood what the experts are only belatedly finding to be true: The benefits from trade to the American economy may not always justify its costs.In a recent study, three economists David Autor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, David Dorn at the University of Zurich and Gordon Hanson at the University of California, San Diego raised a profound challenge to all of us brought up to believe that economies quickly recover from trade shocks. In theory, a developed industrial country like the United States adjusts to import competition by moving workers into more advanced industries that can successfully compete in global markets.They examined the experience of American workers after China erupted onto world markets some two decades ago. The presumed adjustment, they concluded, never happened. Or at least hasn t happened yet. Wages remain low and unemployment high in the most affected local job markets. Nationally, there is no sign of offsetting job gains elsewhere in the economy. What s more, they found that sagging wages in local labor markets exposed to Chinese competition reduced earnings by $213 per adult per year.In another study they wrote with Daron Acemoglu and Brendan Price from M.I.T., they estimated that rising Chinese imports from 1999 to 2011 cost up to 2.4 million American jobs. These results should cause us to rethink the short- and medium-run gains from trade, they argued. Having failed to anticipate how significant the dislocations from trade might be, it is incumbent on the literature to more convincingly estimate the gains from trade, such that the case for free trade is not based on the sway of theory alone, but on a foundation of evidence that illuminates who gains, who loses, by how much, and under what conditions.

"The protesters win by scaring people into silence which is known in the law as the heckler s veto. when the hecklers scream so loudly, or in this case advertised their intention to scream that the speaker can t speak. When this happens on property owned by the government a prima fascia case has been made I m afraid we are in danger of losing free speech. JUDGE NAPOLITANOThis is what happened when pro-Trump supporters held a peaceful rally in Berkeley:THE BIRTHPLACE OF FREE SPEECH IS NOW OFFICIALLY A PLACE OF OPPRESSION Berkeley students came together to shut down the free speech rights of gay, conservative activist Milo Yiannopoulis in February. Students violently attacked fellow students who tried to attend Milo s scheduled speech, random fires were lit, windows were broken and rocks were thrown. Using violence, threats and intimidation to shut down opposing views is not only un-American it should be illegal. But we re not talking about just any college or city in America, we re talking about UC Berkeley, the former home of free-speech UC Berkeley has now banned conservative commentator and author Ann Coulter, citing security threats.According to Young America s Foundation, student organizers of an upcoming Ann Coulter event at the university were emailed by Berkeley administrators who claimed they were unable to find a safe suitable venue for Coulter. UC-Berkeley, a publicly-funded university, first imposed a series of ridiculous requirements on the speech allegedly in the name of safety. Coulter, we were informed, would be required to deliver her speech in the afternoon; only students would be allowed to attend; and the speech location would not be announced until close to the event, they continued. Against our advice, Coulter agreed to all these requirements. In return, she requested two measures, which actually had something to do with safety. This is as clear-cut a case as it gets that public universities are using taxpayer dollars to shut down conservative speech, while allowing liberal speech only, Young America s Foundation proclaimed. UC-Berkeley has for example, welcomed the corrupt former President of Mexico, Vicente Fox, who has cursed at and mocked Donald Trump, currently the President of the United States. The university, and U-C chancellor Janet Napolitano personally, have revealed themselves to be using taxpayer money for an unconstitutional purpose. Even after Coulter went along with their ruses and guises to shut down her speech, they simply announced, like Kim Jung Un, that it was cancelled. We have no intention of acceding to these unconstitutional acts, the organization concluded. The Ann Coulter lecture sponsored by Young America s Foundation will go forward. Ron Robinson, the President of Young America s Foundation, further declared in a quote that Berkeley disappoints anyone who really believes in free speech. Their actions to ban conservatives while giving leftists a platform reinforces this fact, Robinson claimed. It s a shame that Berkeley is robbing its students of the opportunity to receive a well-rounded education.

home be the change government corruption prominent psychologist says google has power to control elections can shift millions of votes to clinton prominent psychologist says google has power to control elections can shift millions of votes to clinton the free thought project november comment rt people trust the unbiased internet search giant google so much it can actually influence up to million undecided voters to choose hillary clinton for president prominent us psychologist and author robert epstein told rt following years of research despite being a supporter of the democratic presidential nominee dr epstein believes googles unchecked algorithm of placing one candidate over the other in search results constitutes a threat to democracy rt robert how did you discover that google is possibly in cahoots with the clinton campaign re well i didnt find out that they were necessarily supporting hillary clinton thats not what i found at first first through several years of research i found that they had the power to control elections the power to shift the votes so that was more than four years of experimental research with more than people in countries so we established through some very careful experiments that by favoring one candidate in search rankings google can shift a lot of votes more than percent of undecided voters overall and in some demographic groups up to percent of undecided voters people trust search rankings so much that if one candidate is favored in search rankings that shifts peoples votes now more recently many people have established that google has a very close relationship with hillary clinton that didnt come from my research that came from all kinds of investigative research by many people rt are you going to take a look at facebook and twitter as well it looks like social media play an even bigger role in the elections than televised debates re well we know now that facebook has the power to shift about votes to hillary clinton on election day with no one knowing this is occurring all they have to do is send out go out and vote reminders to hillary clintons supporters but not to trumps supporters that would cause a lot of people to vote who would otherwise stay home so yes weve looked at facebook weve looked at twitter but again facebook can shift votes google can shift somewhere between and million votes rt have you been able to find abnormal search results by google in some other countries intended to influence the outcome of elections re we havent look carefully at too many countries weve looked at the uk election in we looked at the national election in india at the lok sabha election in what we do know is that it is the nature of googles algorithm to put one candidate ahead of another that happens automatically that happens as google would say organically so this means that googles algorithm has probably been determining the outcomes of close elections around the world for many years probably actually controlling the winner in as many as percent of the national elections of the world rt what do you think about this threat of big data do you think google and other search engines analyses all search results by an individual for a good purpose re well big data at the moment is a threat its a threat to democracy at least as we have it in the united states its a threat to human freedom its a threat to civil liberties this is mainly because the technologies are very new and new means of control of surveillance of manipulation are being developed which at the moment are not regulated theyre not covered by any laws or regulations so the problem is that these technologies have developed quickly and we have not developed systems for monitoring these technologies weve not developed systems for regulating these technologies obviously we must do so rt youve said that unlike europe russia and china were able to overcome the google monopoly but a lot of people are still using this search engine do you think that the us company can manipulate public opinion in russia as well re well its hard for them to manipulate opinion if they dont dominate that country google dominates most of the countries in the world the only countries it doesnt dominate are russia and china so russia and china are protected a little bit from google but russia and china have their own problems russia has yandex china has baidu and these companies can use techniques just as the ones that google is using and perhaps theyre already using these techniques these techniques can be used by any big tech company that provides a search engine these techniques can be used by any big tech company that provides search suggestions my newest research shows for example that google seems to be favoring hillary clinton in its search suggestions the suggestions it gives you when you first start to type an item and from new research ive done we know that if you suppress negative search suggestions from one candidate that shifts votes and opinions towards that candidate so google is not the only problem any of these big tech companies can use these techniques for surveillance for manipulation for control and i think we have to be concerned about the big tech industries in general around the world not just google rt how do you oppose such great power being wielded by one corporation like google re well the problem with a lot of power being in the hands of one company is that the private company is not answerable to the public the private company does not have people who we voted on the private company might be run almost like a monarchy with the ceo having enormous power and the public having no say whatsoever in what they do even not having access to their internal records so we would have no idea of exactly what theyre doing or how theyre doing it and how theyre making decisions this is potentially very dangerous the situation right now is unprecedented in human history there has never been so much power placed in the hands of so few people who are beyond the reach of any laws beyond the reach of any regulations and who dont necessarily have the public interest in mind rt what about donald trump in your opinion what methods and tricks has donald trump and his loyal media used in this presidential race re well ive said in writing repeatedly and in many interviews that im a very strong supporter of hillary clinton hillary clinton is by far the better candidate donald trump is a very weak candidate he would not make a good leader he would not make a good president plus i know people in his family it makes no sense to me that he is even running for president i dont think he wants to be president i think he just wants to increase his celebrity so that he can start his own television network and i think that steps are now already being taken for him to do that the private company might be run almost like a monarchy with the ceo having enormous power and the public having no say whatsoever in what they do even not having access to their internal records so we would have no idea of exactly what theyre doing or how theyre doing it and how theyre making decisions this is potentially very dangerous i made a prediction on twitter recently you can check this i not only have predicted that he will set up his own television network but that he will launch his network with a guaranteed hit show it will be a reality tv show about donald trump running for president and that will be a hit show so i think thats his only interest here hillary clinton will become our next president its guaranteed and in my opinion donald trump has no interest never had any interest in becoming president rt do you believe that hillary clinton will become us president through the manipulation of public opinion re oh hillary clinton is guaranteed to win this election and i have said previously based on polls that seem to show a kind of a close vote that those polls did not take into account the power that google and other companies have to shift votes thats missing from these polls so once you realize the power that these companies have hillary clinton is absolutely guaranteed to win and she will win in the margin of somewhere between million and million votes if we take the mean the average of those two numbers i guess you could say its pretty clear that she will win by approximately million votes rt given that the united states has such an expensive and powerful media industry would you say that voters in the us have a real picture of the presidential campaign re well voters in the united states i think do get a pretty good picture because we have so many different kinds of media and people are just bombarded with information from newspapers magazines and the internet more than different television channels so i think we do get a pretty complex and deep picture of things but you have to remember that all of these forms of media are competitive so were getting one perspective from one magazine another perspective from another magazine but when you come to something like google theres no competition theres no competitor its a completely different kind of influence its noncompetitive in other words if youre still trying to make up your mind and you go to google and ask a question about the candidates or about some sort of issue related to the election google will show you whatever it wants to show you and that can easily easily tip your opinion one way or the other and theres no competitor theres no way for anyone to compensate what google just told you so this is a completely new and very dangerous kind of influence it has no competition theres no corrective for it and people trust google we know this from surveys people trust google more than they trust any newspaper any magazine or any television station people trust information that they get from a computer much more than information theyre getting from television or a newspaper because they know that television and newspapers are biased because they know that people are actually giving them the information but when they get information out of a computer they mistakenly believe that that information is impartial that information is objective and of course thats not really true but thats what people

"Donald Trump s efforts to reach out to voters of color has been going about as terrible as one might expect it to go. Kayleigh McEnany, an avid Trump supporter, took part in a panel discussion on CNN s Anderson Cooper 360 where she attempted to continue that campaign. Not surprisingly, all she did was got shut down by the black members of the panel, Bakari Sellers and Angela Rae.McEnary began the panel discussion which revolved around black issues, by shouting down the black panelists, citing statistics about black people and poverty, saying that: You might think a 27.2% poverty rate among African American individuals is a good thing but At that point, McEnary is interrupted by Rae who insists that no one had made that claim, asking her to retract the statement.That s when the panel really began to go into melt-down. McEnery tried to position Trump as a civil rights leader who was on the cutting edge of civil rights because he fought for inclusiveness in his clubs. While Trump might have expanded his customer base to include black and Jewish Americans. the other panelists were not buying it for a moment that Trump was a civil rights leader.What McEnery failed to mention, but Rae didn t, is that Trump only began to allow black and Jewish Americans into his clubs after he had been sued for housing discrimination.The best moment of the panel discussion is when Rae lays her thoughts out on the matter. She does not hold back, saying: If you want Donald Trump to say something that s meaningful to black people, and I m not going to be the spokesperson for all black people tonight, but what I m going to tell you is this. Plain and simple. He can disavow his racist butler. He can apologize for those two housing discriminations from the Department of Justice. He can tell me that that Black Lives Matter protester who he said deserves to get beat up, he can retract that and apologize for that. He can tell me that he never meant to say those legal fees of that guy that punched that black man in the face at his rally, should ve happened. He can apologize for the Indian man that was thrown out of his rally today. He can apologize to the Central Park Five Sellers interrupts to say All five of them. for taking out that full-page ad on them I m not done, I m just getting started and I haven t even got to last July, Rae continues. My only point to you is this: Donald Trump doesn t just have a messaging problem.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate voted unanimously on Wednesday to toughen sanctions on North Korea over its nuclear program, human rights record and cyber activities, as U.S. lawmakers sought to crack down on Pyongyang for its nuclear tests. The House of Representatives passed a similar bill last month. Differences between the two are expected to be resolved quickly and Senate Democrats said they expected President Barack Obama would sign the measure into law. The White House has not threatened a veto, but a spokesman told reporters he did not have a response to the bill. Lawmakers said they wanted to make Washington’s resolve clear not just to Pyongyang, but to the United Nations and other governments, especially China, North Korea’s lone major ally and main business partner. The Senate vote for the “North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act” was 96-0. Backing for the bill was so strong that two Republicans vying to be their party’s 2016 presidential nominee, Senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, both left the campaign trail to vote. Senator Bernie Sanders, a Democratic contender, missed the vote. “China, the very entity that could do something about this, is blocking the U.N. Security Council’s action toward this being done on a multilateral basis,” said Republican Senator Bob Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “It will be much more effective if we can get the international community to support us,” said Senator Ben Cardin, the panel’s top Democrat. He drew parallels to U.S. sanctions that became multilateral regimes against Iran and South Africa. Congress has been clamoring for a clampdown since Pyongyang tested a nuclear device in January. Its weekend satellite launch fueled the calls. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told the Senate on Tuesday that North Korea has followed through on plans to re-start a plutonium production reactor and could begin to assemble a plutonium stockpile within months. The Senate bill would sanction anyone who engages in, facilitates or contributes to North Korea’s proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, arms-related materials, luxury goods, human rights abuses, activities undermining cyber security and the provision of materials for such activities. Penalties include the seizure of assets, visa bans and denial of government contracts. Unusually, the measure makes most of the sanctions mandatory, rather than giving the president the option to impose them. He can temporarily waive them by making the case that doing so would threaten national security.",1,fakenewsnet,,Senate unanimously backs tougher North Korea sanctions

"Donald Trump treated Americans who oppose him as the enemy on Saturday and delivered the most divisive speech ever given by a president.Rather than attend the White House Correspondents Dinner, Trump skipped the event instead to hold a rally in Pennsylvania where he displayed the kind of pettiness and divisiveness that are unprecedented in presidential history. It s time for all of us to remember that we are one people with one great American destiny, and that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots, and we all share the same glorious freedoms of our magnificent country, Trump said, suggesting that Americans who oppose him are not patriots.Trump also bragged about the size of his crowd, despite the fact that it was not a record, and bragged about his achievements in his first 100 days even though he has been a complete failure who has done nothing but sign tyrannical executive orders and play golf while having no major legislation reach the Oval Office desk.Indeed, Trump s attempt to repeal the popular Affordable Care Act failed spectacularly and his executive orders on immigration have been blocked by the courts.Trump also treated a protester like shit at the rally, ordering security to get him out of here, as Nazis stood by in approval.Trump speech was not presidential. It was meant strictly to pander to his vile base of deplorable supporters who still supoort him no matter how much he lies or how much he destroys our country.And David Gergen, who served as an adviser to Nixon, Ford, and Reagan, trashed Trump s disturbing speech. This was the most divisive speech I have ever heard from a sitting American president, Gergen said. Others may disagree about that. He played to his base and he treated his other listeners, the rest of the people who have been disturbed about him or opposed him, he treated them basically as, I don t give a damn what you think because you re frankly like the enemy. I thought it was a deeply disturbing speech. Here s the video via YouTube.Donald Trump should be impeached and everything he has done should be reversed and erased as if he never held office. He should also be put in prison for colluding with Russia, attempting to sabotage the United States, and violating the Constitution. Acting like a hateful and vengeful dictator should not be tolerated in this country.Featured Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",0,fakenewsnet,, WATCH: Former Reagan Adviser Is Totally DISGUSTED By Trump’s Divisive Rally Speech

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration on Friday blocked new exploration for oil and gas in Arctic waters, in a win for environmental groups that had fought development of the ecologically fragile region. The Department of the Interior released a 2017 to 2022 leasing plan that blocked drilling in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas off northern Alaska. It also limited petroleum development in the Cook Inlet off south-central Alaska. Environmental activists have battled drilling in Alaska to protect whales, walruses and seals, and as part of a broader movement to keep remaining fossil fuels in the ground. The Interior Department said the plan was “balanced,” and left 70 percent of economically recoverable oil and gas resources open to drilling, mostly in the Gulf of Mexico. The plan focuses on the best areas “with the highest resource potential, lowest conflict and established infrastructure - and removes regions that are simply not right to lease,” Interior Secretary Sally Jewell said. President Barack Obama, who last year became the first sitting president to cross the Arctic Circle, has made fighting climate change and protecting the Arctic priorities in his administration. But President-elect Donald Trump, a Republican who takes office on Jan. 20, 2017, has vowed to open resources to petroleum development and could take steps to reverse the decision. Oil interests have pressured the administration to explore for energy in the Arctic. Jack Girard, the head of the American Petroleum Institute industry group, said the decision “puts the U.S. at a serious competitive disadvantage.” Russia and Norway have also explored the Arctic, though Exxon Mobil wound down drilling in the Russian north in 2014 due to U.S. sanctions over Moscow’s aggression in eastern Ukraine. Fierce winds and frigid waters make the Arctic treacherous for drilling equipment. After spending billions of dollars to explore the Alaskan Arctic, Royal Dutch Shell retreated in 2015 after suffering a gash in one of its ships and environmentalists had uncovered details of an old law that forced the company to cut exploration there by half. The U.S. Coast Guard complained when Shell was drilling off Alaska that it had been forced to divert resources, including a vessel that fought cocaine trafficking, to keep operations in the region safe. (reut.rs/2g4yHSW) Environmentalists applauded the new lease plan, which built on a similar decision in March when the government removed much of the Atlantic ocean from oil and gas leasing for five years. “This is excellent news for our oceans, from the Arctic to the Atlantic,” said Jacqueline Savitz, deputy vice president for U.S. campaigns of Oceana, an international advocacy group.",1,fakenewsnet,,Obama administration bars new oil exploration in Arctic waters

"Paul Ryan just gave another one of his notoriously lukewarm endorsements of Donald Trump. Intent on walking the thin line between backing his party s nominee and dumping Trump, the speaker of the house has tried to set himself up to come out smelling like a rose regardless of the outcome of tomorrow s election.During a radio interview on Monday, Ryan conceded that, yes, Trump won the Republican nomination fair and square. However, when conservative host Charlie Sykes asked if the GOP was now Trump s party, Ryan made it as clear as he could that no, the Republican party does not belong to Donald Trump. It is no one person s party. Donald Trump won the primary fair and square, Ryan said. As a party leader, as the highest elected official in the party, I have always felt a duty to the process, to democracy, to the primary voter who must be respected. And he won this fair and square, Ryan added. But no one person controls this party. This is a bottom-up, organic grassroots party based on conservative principles. What a ringing endorsement to give on the eve of the election. (Insert sarcasm here.)Ryan was slow to endorse Trump and has repeatedly condemned the bombastic billionaire s offensive actions. Ryan denounced the Muslim ban as unconstitutional and declared Trump s attacks on the Mexican-American judge presiding over a Trump University lawsuit as the textbook definition of racism. But Ryan just doesn t have the cajones to stand up and walk away from Trump.Sykes asked the speaker about the long list of women who have come forward to accuse Trump of sexually assaulting them after the Access Hollywood tape was leaked, in which Trump bragged about committing sexual assault. Suddenly, Ryan leaped back onto the Trump Train. What do you think helps [Sen.] Ron Johnson and Mike Gallagher and all our candidates across the country more in the closing two days of an election: having party discord and having party leaders snub each other, or unifying the Republican Party and focusing and prosecuting our case against Hillary Clinton? Ryan responded. What helps Republicans more: infighting or unifying, focusing on Clinton or focusing on our differences as Republicans? the Speaker continued. I don t want to harm our team going into the election. I want to unify our team going into the election so as many of our candidates as possible can win this election. Either Ryan can t make up his mind or he is trying to play both sides.

"Bernie Sanders is on fire, especially after this weekend s resounding victories in Washington, Alaska, and Hawaii, which have propelled the Democratic presidential hopeful s campaign to unprecedented momentum as the Democratic primary moves forward. Speaking in front of a crowd of thousands in Wisconsin on Saturday, Sanders said: Let me begin by thanking the people of Alaska for giving us a resounding victory tonight. We are making significant inroads in Secretary Clinton s lead and we have with your support coming here to Wisconsin, we have a path toward victory. Alright, are you ready for a news alert? We just won the state of Washington. The crowd then erupted. Now, there s a new ad that celebrates those weekend victories with Bernie dancing to the tune of the song The bird is the word, which plays off of the bird that landed on a podium earlier in the week while Sanders was speaking in Portland, Oregon, hence the new nickname Birdie Sanders. The ad highlights the landslide victories in Washington and Alaska on Saturday, and Idaho and Utah earlier in the week.The victories are quite impressive because of the sheer number of voters who overwhelmingly supported Sanders. In Idaho, he won with 78% of the vote. While in Utah he received 79%, Alaska 81%, Washington 72%, and Hawaii with 70%.The Sanders campaign definitely seems to be gaining momentum towards the possibility getting the Democratic nomination.

"(Reuters) - The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, named for former Democratic lawmakers Senator Chris Dodd and Representative Barney Frank, was signed by former President Barack Obama in 2010 as a response to the financial crisis. Dodd-Frank is the most sweeping financial regulatory statute enacted since the response to the Great Depression in the 1930s. It created new regulatory bodies and directed already-existing agencies to write hundreds of regulations aimed at creating stability in the financial markets. Republican lawmakers, including President Donald Trump, have said that Dodd-Frank is burdensome for financial institutions, and many seek to repeal it in whole or part. Trump signed an executive order on Friday that did not mention Dodd-Frank by name. But White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told reporters on Friday, “Dodd-Frank is a disastrous policy that’s hindering our markets” and the order would be the first step taken to review the law. Here are some of the Dodd-Frank law’s main provisions: The Financial Stability Oversight Council Dodd-Frank created the FSOC to monitor risk in the financial system and it was granted the power to deem institutions, including non-bank firms such as asset managers and insurance companies “systemically important financial institutions.” These firms are often called “too-big-to-fail” and subject to additional capital requirements. The Office of Financial Research Dodd-Frank created the independent Office of Financial Research within the Treasury Department to provide data and support related to risks in the financial system to relevant government agencies, including the FSOC. This data is used in part to assess whether a firm is a systemically important financial institution. Consumer Financial Protection Board Dodd-Frank created the CFPB, a federal agency that oversees consumer protection in the financial sector, including banks, payday lenders, credit unions, mortgage servicers and other companies. A federal appeals court ruled in October that the bureau’s structure is unconstitutional because its director, currently Richard Cordray, cannot be removed by the president without cause. That ruling was stayed and has not taken effect pending appeal. Volcker Rule A portion of Dodd-Frank known named for former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker prohibits commercial banks from also engaging in proprietary trading and restricts them from investing in hedge and private equity funds. The Volcker Rule also limits the liabilities that can be taken on by the country’s largest banks. The rule was delayed several times and took effect in July 2015. Some large Wall Street banks asked the Federal Reserve to grant them an additional five-year grace period to comply with the rule. Capital Requirements The law’s so-called capital requirements forced banks to fund themselves more by raising money from shareholders than by borrowing. Regulators used a variety of requirements to force banks to cut their reliance on debt, including by imposing tougher rules for riskier assets. The most stringent requirements fell on the biggest banks. Banks say the process has been costly. Living Wills Dodd-Frank required banks with assets of $50 billion or more to submit living wills to regulators. A bank’s living will is a kind of prepackaged bankruptcy plan that will guide its dissolution and liquidation without taxpayer assistance should it collapse. If these living wills are deemed insufficient by regulators, institutions get another chance to submit a new plan. At that point, if regulators again deem a living will insufficient, a bank can face sanctions. Swaps Push-Out Rule The initial swaps proposal prohibited banks active in swaps markets from receiving federal assistance. The rule was narrowed to apply to only swaps entities. A swaps entity is a swap dealer that is registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission or Securities and Exchange Commission. The rule does not apply to depository banks that have swaps divisions, which remain eligible to be insured by the federal government. Regulated Institutions A number of Dodd-Frank’s provisions were designed to direct agencies to regulate entities such as private equity funds and hedge funds for the first time. It also required a brand new regulatory regime for over-the-counter derivatives, which imposed capital and margin requirements, central clearing and trading transparency rules on the marketplace.",1,fakenewsnet,,"Factbox: Sweeping U.S. Dodd-Frank financial law created new agencies, rules"

It won t sit well with Republicans who are against the TPP. The trade deal is opposed by all Democratic presidential candidates both those still running and those who have dropped out of the race. For a candidate as extreme as Cruz is, he needs something to stand behind that makes him look appealing to moderates. Judging by the Rubio supporters reaction, the stunt may have backfired for Cruz. Then again, far more people are talking about the site than if the campaign had not used a fake photo.

"THIS IS SO IMPORTANT! The transcript and video below should be shared by everyone because the lying politicians and media are in full anti-Trump mode right now. A female police officer from Puerto Rico s police department in Guaynabo called in to a U.S. spanish speaking radio station to tell listeners what is going on in Puerto Rico. The police woman is very upset, crying and sobbing often, and shares how the Mayor of San Juan is politicizing the situation and not offering help.Note that the politicization of this disaster is on steroids with American celebrities claiming genocide by Trump and just outright lies by the politicians who are using this to score votes while the people suffer.The most visible of the politicians is the lying mayor who stood in front of supplies saying she needs help. Well, help is right behind you! What she didn t say is that truckers are not showing up to take the aid to the people! As it turns out, she hasn t been doing HER job and hasn t shown up for meetings with FEMA and the US military on sight. Here s just one of many ridiculous comments by this lying politician: The world will see how we are treated not as second-class citizens, but as animals that can be disposed of, said Mayor Carmen Yul n Cruz.The call and video was recorded September 28th, and highlights the corruption within government within Puerto Rico and the Municipal authority of San Juan. The video is English closed captioned (hit CC option) and a transcript is below:Transcript:Radio Announcer: What is your name?Police Caller: I cannot give my name because I work for Puerto Rico s Police Department. I need to pass this information out because the stuff that is being brought from the U.S. is not being distributed. They are not allowing the Puerto Rican people to receive the donations.Radio Announcer: What part of Puerto Rico are you calling us from right now?Police Caller: I am right now in Guaynabo.Radio Announcer 2: Wow.Radio Announcer 3: But what information do you have? What have you seen?Police Caller: The Mayor, Carmen Yulin, is not allowing anyone to distribute We need what Puerto Ricans need is that the U.S. armed forces come in and distribute the aid. And that they stop the governor, Rosello, and the mayor, Yulin, on doing what they are doing It s an abuse, it looks like communism, in our own island (sobbing) (sobbing continues, inaudible translation due to cries) Police Caller (cont.): People are helping us, but they are not accepting it, they are not accepting anymore help supposedly: they have to wait for the license, that there are no buses. Let me tell you something Boricuas (Puerto Ricans) are dying of hunger (crying continues) This is a bureaucracy, everything has to be protocol, the lines are stretched. We can only give one box of water per person (sobbing continues). The medics here, people are dying, the hospitals are in crisis.Police Caller (cont.): I am embarrassed, as a Boricua to work for Puerto Rico s police and see that we cannot do anything. There are dozens and thousands and thousands of food and when people ask we cannot give anything away because [Mayor] Carmen Yulin says that we cannot take anything out; because everything is a soap opera, everything is a show and there have to be cameras here and there. .Because you know they are just looking for votes for the upcoming years.Radio Announcer 2: WowPolice Caller: And the governor won t move unless there is a camera behind him; [Mayor] Carmen Yulin won t move unless there is a camera behind her. This is how we are living in Puerto Rico, meanwhile artists are giving money and the people of Florida are sending stuff, and I don t know how many more people are helping because we have very limited communication, very limited, and we have no idea what s going on outside; and the people who are sending stuff, they have to come in; they have to come to help Puerto Rico and distribute what is being wasted because what else are we going to do? You tell me, what are we going to do?Radio Announcer #2: Of course the desperation..Radio Announcer #3: We are with our hearts broken listening to you describing this situation which is heartbreaking when we know that so many people are helping this is a police officer speaking.Police Caller: I ve been for one hour and a half just trying to download an application because the phones that they give to us I cannot use them as a police officer due to security measures. But I need to speak for the people because the people are suffering. Because I, as a cop, and other partners are seeing it. A lot of people have been posting videos (sobbing inaudible) and no-one is paying attention.Radio Announcer #3: We are truly sorry for this situation, we did not know that..Police Caller: If Cuba and Venezuela want to help and we are grateful for that; and that the government denies their help, the government denies Cuba s help. That they reject Venezuela s help, Look for God s sake! Tell me how is that possible, we need help.Radio Announcer #3: We are going to send this message out so that it gets to where it needs to get to Police Caller: We want the U.S. to come in, that the strongest forces come in and take the governor out, he is not doing anything, he is just going around and around, and everyone is like: oh, look how nice, the governor, he is going in the mud, he is going in the water , And where is it? Pardon the expression: WHERE IS THE FOOD?Police Caller (cont.): Look, grab the food, grab the sausage can and take it to the families! Stop the show! The governor is just doing a show, is all a show. There are many mayors that are suffering because they cannot do anything for their people.Radio Announcer #2: What are they doing with the food? Is it being kept in storage because they are not allowing to give it out?Police Caller: They are not doing anything, and they tell the harbors (ports) that they cannot bring stuff anymore. If the U.S. government doesn t get involved they will finish us. We are going to end up worse. Worse than Cuba, Africa, or worse than Haiti. We are living in an era that you don t want to see, people are desperate. The gasoline, people are already killing each other. Not to rob you, they are doing it so they can be the firsts to get food and take it to their families.Police Caller (cont.): Do you know what it is when a woman approaches me and tells me I don t have any more. I don t know what else to give my kids because I don t have anymore. Water and crackers !Radio Announcer #1: Sweetie, thank you for calling us and using this medium to denounce this situation; and good thing that it was you who explained this so that people don t think that we are making up stuff; because this has nothing to do with politics.

"RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - A judge in Brazil has ordered the detention of several top political figures in Rio de Janeiro, including the president of the state assembly, federal prosecutors said on Tuesday. Police were also serving 10 arrest warrants in the capital Brasilia regarding more than $100 million in contracts involving state bank Caixa Economica Federal in a separate investigation, prosecutors said, suggesting a years-long anti-corruption push may be far from over. According to a prosecutors s statement, Judge Abel Gomes has put out a bench warrant for Rio state assembly president Jorge Picciani, two other state assemblymen, and 10 other persons, including legislative aides. They are accused of accepting bribes from the state s transportation industry body in exchange for favorable legislation going back to the governorship of S rgio Cabral, who held power from 2007 to 2014 and was arrested in 2016 on corruption charges. The arrested deputies were members of embattled President Michel Temer s PMDB party. Also on Tuesday, Brazil s federal police said in a statement that it was carrying out 10 search and detention orders in the capital Brasilia, some of them relating to employees of state bank Caixa Economica Federal.

"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Syrian troops crossed to the eastern side of the Euphrates in Deir al-Zor on Monday, state media and a monitoring group said, increasing their presence in an area where U.S.-backed militias have also advanced. The rival forces are conducting offensives against Islamic State and have generally stayed out of each other s way, with the river often acting as a dividing line. However, incidents this year have raised tension between the government side, backed by Russia, and the U.S.-backed forces. Talks have been under way to extend a formal demarcation line, officials have said. A commander in a militia of the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) confirmed Syrian army units had crossed and said his fighters were ready to drive them back. If there are clashes between us and them - we re ready for those if the forces of the regime don t go back to the other bank, Ahmed Abu Khawla of the SDF s Deir al-Zor military council said. Russia s foreign ministry said on Friday Syrian government forces crossed the river for the first time in their offensive against the jihadist group in Deir al-Zor province. Monday s crossing took place near a southern suburb of the city seized by the army on Saturday, the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Syrian state news agency SANA said heavy fighting took place against Islamic State in the area. The militant group said via its online Amaq news agency that it had deployed at least two suicide car bombs against government forces. The convergence of the Syrian army offensive from the west and the SDF operation from the east has led to increased tensions. The SDF said they came under attack from Syrian forces and Russian jets backing them on Saturday, after Abu Khawla said they would not allow the army to cross the river and would consider shots fired in their direction as an attack. The SDF has advanced to within kilometres of the river, while the Syrian army has retaken much of the city, most of it on the western side. President Bashar al-Assad has vowed to recapture all of Syria. Assad controls the main urban centres in the west of the country. The SDF, dominated by the Kurdish YPG militia, controls much of Syria s northeast. Syrian rebel groups which have fought against Assad since 2011 hold pockets of territory in western Syria. Islamic State s shrinking territory includes much of oil-rich Deir al-Zor province.",1,fakenewsnet,,"Syrian army sends more troops across Euphrates, near U.S.-backed forces"
"Barack Hussein Obama has not exactly done a stellar job convincing America he s a Christian. He spent his entire career as Christian in a church that preached hate against America and the white man. His own preacher, the racist Reverend Wright admitted that Obama only became a Christian to help himself become better integrated with the people who he was trying to embed himself with as a Community Organizer. Even the casual observer couldn t help but notice that while Obama s been in office, he s done everything but backflips to defend the Islamic faith, while bashing Christianity. Bill O Reilly shared photos of Barack Obama in traditional Islamic dress on his program Wednesday night claiming they were from his half-brother Malik s wedding.The Fox News host said it was very difficult to verify the exact location of the photographs a similar set of which were first released back in 2004 by Malik and previously published on DailyMail.com but claimed they were taken in Maryland in the early 1990s. According to his half-sister, Barack Obama attended his half-brother s wedding in the early 1990s. Malik Obama was a Muslim, said O Reilly. The Factor has obtained pictures allegedly from that wedding, which we believe was held in Maryland. Malik was married in 1981 for the first time and President Obama was his best man at that ceremony. He now has multiple wives.O Reilly used the photos in a monologue alleging the President s deep emotional ties to Islam have stopped him effectively combating ISIS while also saying he believes the photos prove that President Obama is not a devout Christian. He did this while attacking President Obama hours after he revealed he would not be withdrawing troops from Afghanistan, saying: President Obama, as we all know, will not even use the words Islamic terrorism. Again today when telling the nation that America will maintain eight-thousand troops in Afghanistan, the president did not accurately describe the situation there, putting forth that it was more about politics than Islamic terror. O Reilly claims the President Obama s failure to identify the terrorist threat facing America has allowed ISIS to run amok in the Middle East, a mistake he claims the Commander-in-chief will not acknowledge. There is no question the Obama administration s greatest failure is allowing the Islamic terror group ISIS to run wild, murdering thousands of innocent people all over the world, including many Muslims, said O Reilly. Mr. Obama has never, never acknowledged that mistake, nor does he define the ISIS threat accurately. That group is killing innocent people in order to impose a radical version of Islam on the world. The jihad is solely based on theology, perverted as it may be. Obama s refusal to use the phrase Islamic terrorism , preferring instead to say militants or simply terrorists has long been a sore spot for his Republican detractors, including Donald Trump.O Reilly also said of Obama after sharing the photos: I believe he s a Christian. I m not one of these guys who says he s a Muslim. But I don t think he s a devout Christian. He went on to say during the program: I base my analysis on the fact that in my opinion and I could be wrong, but I m not President Obama s sympathetic treatment of Muslims put the country in danger because he has not elevated the risks that we have to the level it should be. And he allowed ISIS to be created because of his foolish decision to withdraw troops in Iraq and to pretty much run wild for five years. So another president, angry about the jihad, would not have done that. O Reilly s guest, Obama: From Promise to Power author David Mendell, jumped in at that point to say: I think President Obama is very sympathetic to all cultures, all religions. He grew up in a multiplicity The host cut him off though to ask: Is that good for a commander in chief to be very sympathetic to all cultures and all beliefs when thousands of people are being murdered? O Reilly then closed out the segment by stating: He s the commander in chief of the United States, and his main charge is to protect us. It s not main charge as to be touchy-feely to all different cultures.

"UMM AL HAWAYA, Qatar (Reuters) - Deep in the Qatari desert, a herd of cows stands in a vast shed, cooled by fans and jets of mist - each animal a key player in a plan to defy a trade boycott and make the kingdom self-sufficient in milk by next year. The black and white Holstein cattle are among the first members of a 14,000-strong herd that farming company Baladna is expecting to build up in coming months, its chief executive John Dore told Reuters in an interview. We will make Qatar self-sufficient by June - that is the target, Dore said. He conceded that raising and milking cows in temperatures nearing 50 degrees Celsius (120 Fahrenheit) in summer posed special challenges. But technology and the deep pockets of Baladna s Qatari owners were compensating for the harsh environment, said Dore, an Irishman who previously worked for Saudi Arabian dairy giant Almarai. Hundreds of cows were already hooked up to the automatic milking machines at Baladna s farm in Umm al Hawaya, about 50 km (30 miles) north of Doha, and producing milk good enough to export, he said. More than 6,000 more cows from the United States are due to arrive by February. Qatar s drive to build a dairy industry in the desert illustrates how the tiny but wealthy country, the world s biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas, is using money and technology to cope with its isolation. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut trade and transport ties with Qatar in June, accusing it of backing terrorism, a charge which Doha denies. The boycott disrupted Qatar s shipping routes through the Gulf. It also shut Qatar s land border with Saudi Arabia, across which many perishable goods were imported, including almost 400 tonnes of fresh milk and yoghurt a day. The boycott has forced Qatar to fly in dairy products from Turkey and Iran. But Dore said the country was determined to create its own dairy sector, largely relying on Baladna, a private company which is receiving logistical and other support from the government. The firm, which raises sheep, was considering moving into milk production before the boycott, but knew it would find it hard to compete on price with imports from Almarai, he said. The boycott removed that competition and in the initial weeks of the diplomatic crisis, the company flew in the first 3,400 cows on state-owned airline Qatar Airways. We were milking cows here on the 11th of July, which is barely a month after the blockade, and that by any method or means is some achievement, Dore said. Baladna is planning two more sea shipments from the United States - each holding 3,300 animals - by February. Another consignment of 3,000 cows has been planned, but not yet ordered. By June, it says it is expecting to raise production of fresh milk and yoghurt to 500 tonnes a day, enough to meet domestic demand with 100 tonnes left over for export. Baladna has not disclosed financial details of its project, and it is not yet clear whether Qatar can produce large volumes of milk economically, let alone export some at competitive prices. But for now at least, the country s drive to reduce its dependence on imports with domestic production appears to be stimulating the economy. The manufacturing sector grew 3.2 percent from a year earlier in September, official data released last week showed. Food manufacturing jumped 23.5 percent.",1,fakenewsnet,,Qatar builds dairy industry in desert as it defies Arab boycott

"TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - The sister of Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez and five others died when the helicopter they were traveling in crashed on Saturday, the Honduran military said. Hilda Hernandez, 51, was a close advisor to her brother, who is embroiled in political turmoil in the wake of a Nov. 26 presidential election, which remains unresolved. She was previously the government s communications secretary. Two reconnaissance helicopters were sent to comb the missing Eurocopter AS350 Ecureuil helicopter s planned flight path from Toncontin international airport in capital city Tegucigalpa to Comayagua, some 50 miles (80 km) northwest, but because of inclement weather conditions land teams were sent in, the Honduran armed forces said in the statement. The remains of the aircraft were located and no survivors were found, the armed forces said, adding it would investigate the causes of the crash. A government source, who asked not to be named said: The six people aboard the aircraft, including Hilda Hernandez have been found dead. Honduras has been roiled by political instability following the presidential vote, with center-left Salvador Nasralla, a TV star, trailing conservative incumbent Hernandez by 1.6 percentage points according to the official count.

"The parents of a 6th grade student at Live Oak Classical School, located in Waco, Texas, are outraged over school officials failure to take action against a group of alleged white student bullies.The 12-year-old victim, who is referred to in media reports as KP, says that a group of three white boys have repeatedly injured and accosted her at the school, where she is one of only a handful of Black students.According to Vibe the boys have approached KP in the hallway, shoving her and kicking her. Her parents sent an email to the school in November, asking officials to address the situation.School officials responded by saying that they spoke with the boys and had determined that the kicking incident was meant as a joke. In April, students of the school were taken on a field trip to a nearby ranch. According to the girl, she was standing next to a rope swing when the same group of white boys grabbed the rope, wrapped it around her neck and then threw her violently to the ground.Images of the girl s neck show rope burns that are consistent with her story.This time school officials claim that KP s injuries were the result of an accident, not intentional racist bullying.If that s not enough, they are now insinuating that the 12-year-old and her family are trying to milk the school for money.After school officials refused to address the behavior of the student bullies, KP s parents contacted an attorney. The attorney then contacted the school. School officials provided the media with a copy of an email stating that the family would be willing to settle for $2.7 million.After repeated attempts to get the school to deal with the students responsible for their daughter s injuries, the girl s parents decided to hit them where it hurts. Good for them.As Vibe reports here, KP s parents decided to send their daughter to the expensive private school in Waco, Texas, so she could receive a better education, in what they assumed would be a wholesome learning environment. According to its website, the school claims to have a Christian worldview. Live Oak Classical School has a student body that is 87 percent white and just two percent Black. It s located in Waco, Texas, an area of the country that has a long and ugly history of racism.The willingness of school officials to downplay and dismiss allegations of racist bullying speaks for itself.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton took on the Wells Fargo & Co bogus-accounts case in a letter to the bank’s customers to be released on Tuesday, when Wells Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf will testify before a Senate committee. Clinton, who faced accusations during her party’s primary elections of representing Wall Street’s interests, said in the letter that Stumpf “owes all of you a clear explanation as to how this happened under his watch.” Earlier this month, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other regulators announced a $185 million settlement with the bank for creating 2 million phantom accounts under actual customers’ names in a bid to meet internal sales goals. In the letter sent to customers, Clinton laid out a three-prong plan to address what she called “the culture of misconduct and recklessness” in the banking system. It included “clawing back” the compensation of individual executives involved in wrongdoing and breaking up big banks that are not managed effectively. She also called for maintaining the CFPB, an agency created in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law that Republican lawmakers would like to reorganize.",1,fakenewsnet,,Clinton tells Wells Fargo customers CEO owes them an explanation

"This is fantastic! Mike Rowe tells a fan why Trump won nails it! Here is Rowe s post from his Facebook page:Hey Mike. You ve been very quiet. Everything OK? I just wanted you to know that I voted for you. I was also hoping you might explain what the hell happened on Tuesday, and say something to make me feel better about my fellow man. Thanks,Carol SavoyWell, Mike answered Carol and he did so in a very thorough fashion.Hi CarolLast Friday, my dog posted a video that featured a man licking a cat with the aid of a device that s designed for the specific purpose of making it easier for people to lick their cats.I ve been silent ever since, because frankly, I couldn t think of a better way metaphorical or otherwise to express my feelings about this election cycle. The entire country it seems, has been preoccupied with finding a way to lick a cat without actually putting their tongue on it.Too oblique? Too weird? Ok, how about this analysis:Back in 2003, a very unusual TV pilot called Dirty Jobs, Forrest-Gumped its way onto The Discovery Channel and found an audience a big one. For Discovery, this was a problem. You see, Dirty Jobs didn t look like anything else on their channel. It wasn t pretty or careful. It took place in sewers and septic tanks, and featured a subversive host in close contact with his 8-year old inner child who refused to do second takes. Everyone agreed that Dirty Jobs was totally off-brand and completely inappropriate for Discovery. Everyone but the viewers. The ratings were just too big to ignore, so the pilot got a green-light, and yours truly finally got a steady gig.But here s the thing Dirty Jobs didn t resonate because the host was incredibly charming. It wasn t a hit because it was gross, or irreverent, or funny, or silly, or smart, or terribly clever. Dirty Jobs succeeded because it was authentic. It spoke directly and candidly to a big chunk of the country that non-fiction networks had been completely ignoring. In a very simple way, Dirty Jobs said Hey we can see you, to millions of regular people who had started to feel invisible. Ultimately, that s why Dirty Jobs ran for eight seasons. And today, that s also why Donald Trump is the President of the United States.I know people are freaked out, Carol. I get it. I m worried too. But not because of who we elected. We ve survived 44 Presidents, and we ll survive this one too. I m worried because millions of people now seem to believe that Trump supporters are racist, xenophobic, and uneducated misogynists. I m worried because despising our candidates publicly is very different than despising the people who vote for them.For what it s worth, Carol, I don t think Donald Trump won by tapping into America s racist underbelly, and I don t think Hillary lost because she s a woman. I think a majority of people who voted in this election did so in spite of their many misgivings about the character of both candidates. That s why it s very dangerous to argue that Clinton supporters condone lying under oath and obstructing justice. Just as it s equally dangerous to suggest a Trump supporter condones gross generalizations about foreigners and women.These two candidates were the choices we gave ourselves, and each came with a heaping helping of vulgarity and impropriety. Yeah, it was dirty job for sure, but the winner was NOT decided by a racist and craven nation it was decided by millions of disgusted Americans desperate for real change. The people did not want a politician. The people wanted to be seen. Donald Trump convinced those people that he could see them. Hillary Clinton did not.As for me, I m flattered by your support, but grateful that your vote was not enough to push me over the top. However, when the dust settles, and The White House gets a new tenant, I ll make the same offer to President Trump that I did to President Obama to assist as best I can in any attempt to reinvigorate the skilled trades, and shine a light on millions of good jobs that no one seems excited about pursuing.Like those 3 million shovel ready jobs we heard so much about eight years ago, the kind of recovery that Donald Trump is promising will require a workforce that s properly trained and sufficiently enthused about the opportunities at hand. At the moment, we do not have that work force in place. What we do have, are tens of millions of capable people who have simply stopped looking for work, and millions of available jobs that no one aspires to do. That s the skills gap, and it s gotta close. If mikeroweWORKS can help, we re standing by.If not, I suppose we ll just have to find another way to lick the cat.MikeBe sure to check out Mike s Facebook page.",0,fakenewsnet,,NAILS IT!

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Monday the Senate will move to repeal President Barack Obama’s healthcare law shortly after Jan. 1, but declined to give a timeline for a plan to replace it. McConnell said the Senate would vote as soon as it returns from its year-end recess to repeal Obamacare. “And then we will work expeditiously to come up with a better program than current law, because current law is simply unacceptable and not sustainable,” he said. Asked repeatedly, McConnell did not give any timeline for when the Republicans would offer their own plan. He said they would be consulting with different “stakeholders.” Donald Trump’s election as U.S. president last month means Republicans will control the White House, Senate and House of Representatives in 2017. The new Congress goes to work on Jan. 3; Trump will be sworn in on Jan. 20. Republicans in both the Senate and House of Representatives say they want to repeal Obamacare early in 2017. But Republicans have not agreed on how quickly the Obamacare repeal should go into effect. A delay would give them time to work on a replacement, instead of throwing millions of Americans out of their health insurance with no substitute.",1,fakenewsnet,,McConnell will not give timeline for Obamacare replacement
"21st Century Wire says Since 2011 the United States government, led by President Barack Obama, has adopted an open policy of supporting an armed opposition in Syria. While certain officials have only recently admitted to arming and funding these militants, evidence shows that the support has been pouring in through both covert means and official channels from the onset of the conflict. We now know that those commonly referred to in the western media as rebels in Syria are comprised mainly of religious extremists and designated terrorists. Despite this revelation, the US, UK, France, along with Saudi Arabia, Qatar and others have continued to back them, and even go so far as to color them with political legitimacy all in a grand effort to try and achieve regime change in Syria. It s not the first time either that Washington has pursued this same policy of destablization in order to overthrow a foreign government.President Donald Trump has an opportunity to reverse this backwards US policy. Will he capitalize on the opportunity to start anew, or will the US revert back to its old deep state default position? The passage of Hawaii Congresswomen Tulsi Gabbard s recently proposed piece of legislation entitled, Stop Arming Terrorists Act, would be positive move in that direction. Will President Trump champion her bill?The following is an open letter from writer Steven Sahiounie to the US Government To the Government of the United States of America:I am asking my American government to stop supporting terrorists in Syria. The US government, and media, keep calling them moderate rebels , but they are not. They were never moderate, and many are not rebels. By definition, a rebel is rebelling against their own government. However, many of the US backed rebels are not Syrian, and have no family ties to Syria, and have never been a citizen of Syria. For example, how could a Chinese citizen fight in a rebellion against the American government? By what right does a Chinese citizen have to kill and maim in order to change the US government? It is wrong and makes no sense.I would never advocate, or support any armed attack, or rebellion against the American government. There are laws against murdering, raping, kidnapping and maiming people in USA. The same such laws exist in Syria. How could a democracy and a world leader like USA advocate murdering, raping, kidnapping and maiming innocent Syrian people?From the out-set of violence and crimes in Syria in 2011, the US backed rebels used sectarian slogans, and carries out sectarian attacks and massacres. Syria is a secular form of government, as is USA. Why would American leaders support the targeting of minorities in Syria, when the President of America is himself a minority? Why would the US government support the destruction on churches and mosques? American s value religious freedom, and equality of minorities; yet the US backed Free Syrian Army destroyed churches, targeted Christians, attacked Christian villages, as well as targeting Muslim minority sects with similar acts: such as Kessab, Ballouta, Mahardeh, and Maaloula among many others.The US government sent weapons, missiles, special training, equipment, food, medical supplies, communications, and satellite imagery to the Free Syrian Army from 2011 to 2016. Yet, the current exodus of evacuees from East Aleppo has not received even one loaf of bread from USA. While the US backed FSA had many warehouses full of food and medicines they have left behind as they retreated deeper into East Aleppo. Finally, the rebels who agreed to vacate recently have burned all the medical supplies and food storages, which were the gifts of the American taxpayers, so as to prevent the distribution of those supplies to the starving masses who have fled East Aleppo now.American citizens are currently very concerned about Syrian refugees coming to USA who may have had ties to terrorism. The US backed rebels are exactly the type of people the American citizens should be afraid of as possible new neighbors, living in their midst as settled refugees. They are the type of people who would chop off the head of their neighbor because his religion is not exactly the same as theirs. They are the type of people who are willing to take money from a foreign government for the purpose of destroying their own community. They are the type of people who do not value religious freedom, or minority rights. What would happen when the US backed rebels , who may be settled in USA, decide to rebel against the American government? Will the US President and Congress call them freedom fighters ? Or, perhaps America s enemies will fund and support their armed attacks on the US government and civilians?We should all be united in our plea: please stop supporting terrorism in Syria, and around the world.Steven Sahiounie***21WIRE Special Contributor Steven Sahiounie is an American citizen born in Fresno, California.

"WASHINGTON The clock began running out this week on a strategy that has provided U.S. Republicans in Congress with their only notable legislative successes this year: aggressive use of an obscure U.S. law known as the Congressional Review Act (CRA). On his 75th day in power, President Donald Trump has yet to offer any major legislation or win passage of a bill he favors, but House of Representatives Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy has notched numerous small-scale victories with his strategy. Vice President Mike Pence told business leaders at the White House on Tuesday that Trump would sign more CRA resolutions soon and roll back an “avalanche of red tape” from the administration of President Barack Obama, a Democrat. REUTERS COMMENTARYWar College: One tank to rule them allThe right way to address the Marines United Facebook GroupIn legal battles against travel ban, Trump's own statements are his worst enemy Since Trump took office on Jan. 20, McCarthy has led Congress in churning out 13 resolutions under the CRA killing Obama-era regulations, most of concern to business interests. Trump has signed 11 of these into law, not only rolling back the rules they targeted but also barring agencies from writing “substantially similar” regulations in the future. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said on Tuesday the number of resolutions signed over two months showed Trump is “vastly different” from past presidents in rolling back regulations. On Monday Trump signed a CRA resolution repealing broadband privacy protections. He has also signed resolutions killing rules meant to expand background checks for mentally ill gun purchasers, change public school assessments, and reduce coal waste runoff into streams. Last Friday was the deadline for introducing any new CRA resolutions on regulations enacted by Obama’s administration. Now Republicans must complete voting on resolutions already in the legislative pipeline by mid-May. Democrats assail the reversals as harming the environment, education and checks on Wall Street, with many saying the regulations were killed in order to please big-money lobbyists. Representative Louise Slaughter, the senior Democrat on the Rules Committee that sends resolutions to the House floor for votes, said in an interview “of course it benefits the lobbyists.” But she said fumbles around healthcare and tax reform also pushed CRA resolutions to the fore. “Partly I think it’s because they don’t have anything else to do,” she said about Republicans’ eagerness. “Other than that I think it’s just another ‘take that Obama.’” McCarthy, a Californian and the No. 2 House Republican, saw the CRA’s potential before the election. Written in 1996 and successfully used only once before 2017, the law was originally meant to restore the balance of power between Congress and the federal bureaucracy. But lobbyists and lawmakers recognized it could be used as a policy weapon, if the stars aligned. Under the law, resolutions only need simple majorities in each chamber to go on for the president’s signature. So one party must control both the legislative and executive branches for it to work. The law sets a short time span for introducing disapproval resolutions: 60 legislative days after a regulation is finalized, meaning it can only be used right after a president of an opposing party leaves office. The stars aligned on Nov. 8, when Republicans captured the White House, Senate and House. For weeks Republican lawmakers bombarded McCarthy with lists of regulations to repeal and lobbying groups laid plans. The first disapproval resolutions were introduced on Jan. 30. Right after the election, McCarthy told his party to “go through each regulation on our priority list,” he said. “If you look at Article One of the Constitution, this isn’t the role of these agencies. The agencies have become too big,” McCarthy said in an interview with Reuters. The first resolutions sailed through, primarily because Republicans had opposed the regulations long before they were finalized. McCarthy said so many lawmakers objected to the stream pollution rule that wiping it off the books was easy. Even though the CRA effort is winding down, McCarthy’s brief campaign showed that aggressive use of the law could succeed, and provided Republicans with some modest, but needed successes in a time when they are struggling with larger matters. “After years of talk about cutting red tape, it is now actually happening,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said on Tuesday. “We are reversing the Obama administration’s most recent and last regulatory onslaught.”",1,fakenewsnet,,Window closing for Republican stealth assault on U.S. regulations

"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday called the Iraqi Kurdish independence referendum illegitimate and said Russia and Turkey agreed that the territorial integrity of Iraq and neighboring Syria must be preserved. Erdogan spoke after face-to-face talks in Ankara with President Vladimir Putin. The Russian leader gave no opinion of the vote, saying Moscow s position had been set out by the foreign ministry which said it respected the Kurds national striving but supported the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of Iraq. Both Turkey and Russia have strong commercial ties with the semi-autonomous Kurdish region of north Iraq but Turkey - with a large Kurdish population of its own - bitterly criticized Monday s referendum, threatening economic sanctions and a military response. The Kurdish referendum has no legitimacy in terms of the Iraqi constitution and international laws, Erdogan said in his comments at the presidential palace. No one has the right to throw our region in the fire. In this delicate period after the referendum, we have to prevent the Kurdish Regional Government from making bigger mistakes. Turkey has been battling an insurgency in its mainly Kurdish southeast for more than three decades and fears the vote in northern Iraq could fuel separatism within its own borders. Both Erdogan and Putin said they would continue to work together to address the conflict in Syria, where they have supported opposing sides in the struggle between President Bashar al-Assad s government and rebels who fought to overthrow him. The de facto conditions for ending the fratricidal war in Syria, the final destruction of terrorists and Syrians return to a normal life have been created, said Putin, whose support for Assad helped turn the tide of the six-year conflict in favor of the president. Putin said he and Erdogan confirmed their commitment to four de-escalation zones across Syria, including the northwestern province of Idlib, home to about 2 million people and largely controlled by former Nusra Front militants. Erdogan said last week that Turkish troops will deploy inside Idlib, which is on Turkey s southern border, while Russia would maintain security outside the province. Warplanes conducted a tenth consecutive day of air strikes on the Idlib area on Thursday, targeting insurgent-held towns, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Opposition rescue workers said on Wednesday that Russian and Syrian jets had killed at least 150 civilians in the air raids. Russia says it is only attacking jihadists. Russian media, citing the defense ministry, said 37 Nusra members including five field commanders were killed in a rocket attack in Idlib. The presidents said they wanted to see progress in two major projects, the TurkStream gas pipeline from Russia to Turkey and the Akkuyu nuclear power plant being built in Turkey with Russian collaboration. We place great importance on the realization of these projects swiftly, Erdogan said. We have observed during out talks that there are some disruptions, we will fix them quickly.",1,fakenewsnet,,Turkey's Erdogan calls Iraqi Kurdish referendum illegitimate

"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Official results from Kenya s repeat presidential election on Thursday are likely to take several days to collate, election officials told Reuters, due to changes in the process to try to make it more transparent. The Supreme Court on Sept. 1 ordered a repeat of the election after judges annulled the results of an Aug. 8 poll, pitting incumbent President Uhuru Kenyatta against opposition leader Raila Odinga, due to procedural irregularities. Official results said Kenyatta won on Aug. 8 by 1.4 million votes, but Odinga said the vote was rigged. Odinga has refused to participate in Thursday s rerun because he said election officials have not carried out sufficient reforms. Judges criticized the election board for rushing to announce the official results based only on numbers sent from the polling stations, without having the tally forms from all 40,883 polling stations showing the results. The paper forms are a back-up system meant to help prevent rigging. The board has up to a week to announce official results. This time, polling stations will only transmit scanned images of tally forms from polling stations, not numerical results, Andrew Limo, spokesman for the election commission, said on Tuesday. The scanned images will be posted online. The election board will collate and publish results by constituency once all polling stations there have reported. This could take several days in rural constituencies with poor phone networks and far-flung polling stations. There are 290 constituencies. Without Odinga running, Kenyatta is the firm favorite to win. The other six candidates failed to poll more than 1 percent in the August polls; one has since been disqualified for bankruptcy. Odinga has urged supporters to boycott the ballot and opposition leaders have called for protests on the day of the elections. The key thing to watch in this election will be turnout, said Murithi Mutiga, a senior regional analyst for the International Crisis Group, a global thinktank. This will really be a referendum on the legitimacy of Kenyatta s second term. Just over 79 percent of Kenya s 19.6 million registered voters cast a ballot in the last poll.",1,fakenewsnet,,Kenya officials change way of announcing election results
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday to advance a bill that would impose new sanctions on Iran, the same day at least 12 people were killed in attacks in Tehran, as lawmakers planned to add a package of sanctions on Russia to the measure. The vote was 92-7 on a procedural motion to end debate on the Iran sanctions bill, clearing the way for a vote later on passage of the legislation. Chuck Schumer, the top Senate Democrat, said most members of his party supported the Iran bill, but that they would only agree to let it go ahead because they expected it would be amended to include “a strong package” of new sanctions on Russia as well. Many lawmakers have been clamoring for new sanctions on Russia over its alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region and support for Syria’s government in that country’s six-year-long civil war. Schumer said he was negotiating with the Senate’s Republican leaders on the Russia sanctions. Some senators had urged that Wednesday’s procedural vote be delayed, arguing that the timing was inappropriate because of the attacks in Iran. “The country has just suffered from two significant terrorist attacks after electing a moderate government with 57 percent of the vote — we need to give Iran the opportunity to recover and set a new course,” Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said in a statement. A senior Senate aide said the Iran sanctions measure could come up for a vote as soon as next week. The legislation would impose new sanctions on Iran over its ballistic missile development, arms transfers, support for Islamist militant groups and human rights violations. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed it 18-3 last month. To become law, the measure would also have to pass the Republican-led House of Representatives and be signed by President Donald Trump.",1,fakenewsnet,,"U.S. Senate advances Iran sanctions bill, eyes new Russia sanctions"

"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - If European leaders earned points for the amount of time they spend at summits, French President Emmanuel Macron would probably top the rankings this week. A two-day gathering in Brussels - with talks running past midnight on Thursday - was merely the icing on the cake for Macron, who had already hosted a global climate conference and a counter-terrorism summit in the past four days. He certainly comes with a lot of energy and ideas, one European Council official said of the 39-year-old, who in seven months in office has earned a reputation for burning the candle at both ends, stretching his youthful staff. We just hope we can find a way to channel it. The question is, is it delivering results? When it comes to Europe, the report card is so far mixed, although that s not necessarily Macron s fault. During his election campaign and early months in office, he put euro zone reform at the heart of his program, hoping to work hand-in-hand with Germany and other member states on it. But the German election in September weakened Chancellor Angela Merkel s position and she is still trying to put together a coalition, a process unlikely to be completed before March. Without her, Macron lacks a partner to push things along. The discussions he wanted to have on ideas like a separate budget for the single currency area have been pushed back, an acknowledgement that the timing is not right. There are talks on migration, security and defense, all topics addressed by EU leaders on Thursday, but progress is slow and halting, particularly on migration, which led to divisive discussions late into the night. Macron, who in recent weeks has made trips to Africa, met Middle East leaders and brokered the return of Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri from Saudi Arabia, is at the heart of all the exhausting debates. He may want to steer a course somewhere between former President Nicolas Sarkozy, whose hyperactive EU style drove some partners to distraction, and his immediate predecessor Francois Hollande, who was at times considered too low-key. His energy is much appreciated, especially after the blow of Brexit, but he must also try to stay a bit realistic, said a diplomat, mentioning that Macron had managed to raise the Ukraine crisis, the Middle East, euro zone reform and demands that the bloc offer more social protection to citizens. One problem the former investment banker faces is that getting 28 EU leaders to agree on a single course of action is always hard. When he acts outside the EU bubble, he has arguably had more success. His One Planet summit this week drew new green pledges from corporations and international organizations, keeping the battle against climate change high up the global agenda. An unscheduled stop in Saudi Arabia last month for talks with Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman helped clinch the release of Hariri, who flew to Paris and then back to Lebanon, where he withdrew his resignation as prime minister. Macron has in some ways taken the international reins at a time when several Western leaders are otherwise engaged - Britain s Theresa May is tied up with Brexit, Merkel is bogged down in coalition politics and President Donald Trump s first year in office has been chaotic and unpredictable. His main rival for geopolitical engagement is Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has invited him to be guest of honor at the economic forum in St. Petersburg next May. No confirmation yet of whether Macron will find the time to go.",1,fakenewsnet,,Multi-summit Macron burns energy in hunt for results

"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran will not be bullied by the United States and will react strongly to any wrong move by Washington on Tehran s nuclear deal, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Sunday. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that Iran was violating the spirit of the 2015 deal under which it got sanctions relief in return for curbing its nuclear program. State television quoted Khamenei as saying Iran was standing firm and any wrong move by the domineering regime regarding the (nuclear accord) will face the reaction of the Islamic Republic. Washington extended some sanctions relief for Iran on Thursday under the nuclear deal with world powers, but said it had yet to decide whether to maintain the agreement. Trump must make a decision by mid-October whether to certify that Iran is complying with the deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). If he does not, Congress has 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions. Today, despite all the commitments and discussions in the negotiations, America s attitude toward these negotiations and their outcome is completely unjust and amounts to bullying, Khamenei said in a speech to Iranian police academy graduates. The Americans should know ...there will be no retreat by the Islamic Republic. The Foreign Ministry in Tehran condemned as continued Iranophobia Washington s move on Thursday to impose sanctions on 11 individuals and firms, including two based in Ukraine, state news agency IRNA reported. The U.S. Treasury accused the 11 of supporting Iran s ballistic missile program or its Revolutionary Guards, or engaging in cyber attacks against the U.S. financial system. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Sunday he believed Iran was in technical compliance with the nuclear deal but had stepped up destabilizing activities in Yemen and Syria and continued to have an active ballistic missile program. None of that, I believe, is consistent with that preamble commitment that was made by everyone in the nuclear deal, he told CBS Face the Nation. Iran said last month it could abandon the nuclear agreement within hours if the United States imposed any new penalties, after Washington ordered unilateral sanctions over Tehran s ballistic missile tests. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, speaking on Sunday before leaving to attend a U.N General Assembly meeting in New York, said Washington should join the countries that continued to support the nuclear deal, which he compared to a dinner party. They can choose the right path and also enter the room where the food is served. We would not have a problem with that, IRNA quoted Rouhani as saying. The United States imposed unilateral sanctions, saying Tehran s ballistic missile tests violated a U.N. resolution that endorsed the nuclear deal and called on Tehran not to undertake activities related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons.

"Senate Republicans sink to a new disgraceful low in their childish effort prevent President Obama from filling the vacant Supreme Court seat.When asked about potential Supreme Court nominees, John Cornyn, the second highest ranking Republican in the Senate literally issued a threat to anyone who might accept the nomination from President Obama that their career and reputation will be intentionally ruined by Senate Republicans. I think they will bear some resemblance to a pi ata, Cornyn said according to CNN. What I don t understand is how someone who actually wants to be confirmed to the Supreme Court would actually allow themselves to be used by the administration in a political fight that s going to last from now until the end of the year. Because there is no guarantee, certainly, after that time they re going to look as good as they did going in. Yes, Senate Republicans are so desperate to get their way that they are willing to destroy the life of anyone President Obama nominates to fill the empty Supreme Court seat even if that person has impeccable credentials and is absolutely qualified to do the job.This angered Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid so much that he entered the CNN article into the Congressional Record, where it will remain as an example of just how petulant Republicans have become, and then he took to the Senate floor to blast Cornyn and the GOP. Think about that. They don t know who the nominee is, they don t know anything about the person, but they already have in their mind they are going to beat this person like a pi ata. It doesn t matter who it is. Man, woman, old, young, it doesn t matter. Doesn t matter what their education is, what their experience is, they re going to beat them like a pi ata. I think they ve been listening to Donald Trump too much. The Republicans need to stop and listen to this disgusting rhetoric they re spewing This is vile behavior that is beneath the dignity of this institution. Here s the video of Reid remarks via YouTube:And the American people overwhelmingly agree with Democrats on this issue.Three major polls, including a Fox News poll, reveal that most Americans WANT President Obama to nominate a replacement for Scalia and they WANT Senate Republicans to do their jobs and hold fair confirmation hearings even more. A Rasmussen poll says the same thing, and so does a CNN/ORC poll released this month.But rather than backtrack his remarks and apologize for his utter lack of professionalism, Cornyn doubled down on his threat and this time used the Senate floor to repeat his offensive promise to destroy the reputation and career of anyone who accepts the nomination, suggesting that President Obama would be at fault if Senate Republicans did such a thing. I would be surprised if any person who actually aspired to be on the United States Supreme Court, a current judge or a legal scholar or lawyer, would allow themselves to be used by this administration in making a nomination to the Supreme Court for a seat that will not be filled during the remainder of President Obama s term. Knowing that they won t be confirmed. This is totally outrageous and Senate Republicans should be ashamed of themselves. They have thumbed their nose at the American people and are an embarrassment to the nation and Constitution they claim to serve.Featured Image: Wikimedia",0,fakenewsnet,, GOP Senator Threatens To Ruin Career Of Anyone Who Accepts Obama SCOTUS Nomination

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Republican antitrust veteran has been named on Monday to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team for the Justice Department, a choice that lawyers say signals a more hands-off approach to antitrust enforcement compared to Democratic President Barack Obama. David Higbee, a partner at the law firm Hunton & Williams LLP, worked for President George W. Bush’s administration from 2001 to 2005, spending the last year in the Antitrust Division. Since then he has advised clients on merger reviews, antitrust litigation and government investigations. Higbee joins Joshua Wright, an economist and former commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission, as the only two people on Trump’s transition team with a background in antitrust. The Obama administration has challenged an unusually large number of mergers in the last few years, leading to the collapse of Halliburton Co’s plan to buy Baker Hughes Inc, among others. Currently, the Justice Department is suing Anthem Inc to prevent it from buying Cigna Corp and Aetna Inc to stop its purchase of Humana Inc. While Trump, who campaigned as a populist, has talked tough on media mergers such as AT&T Inc buying Time Warner Inc, and singled out Amazon.com Inc for antitrust scrutiny, Higbee’s naming heralds a return to a traditional Republican view of merger enforcement, lawyers said. “Higbee will have that sensible caution,” said Bruce McDonald, another veteran of the Bush administration now at the law firm Jones Day. “He will be more confident in business and markets and less confident that government can identify and fix problems.” An antitrust division designed by Higbee would be tough on price-fixing and mergers of competitors but would be cautious in challenging deals where companies buy suppliers or incidents where companies are accused of breaking antitrust law to run competitors out of business, McDonald said.",1,fakenewsnet,,Trump adds antitrust expert to Justice transition team
"ST. LOUIS Former St. Louis police Officer Jason Stockley was found not guilty Friday of murdering a man while on duty.St. Louis Circuit Judge Timothy Wilson s highly anticipated verdict found the white former St. Louis police officer not guilty of first-degree murder and armed criminal action in the December 2011 shooting death of a black drug suspect after a high-speed pursuit and crash.Activists, with support from some of the city s black clergy, had pledged disruptive protests ahead of Wilson s verdict.Wilson addressed such statements in his order: A judge shall not be swayed by partisan interests, public clamor or fear of criticism. Immediately after the verdict was issued, protesters gathered downtown near Tucker Boulevard and Market Street. They blocked a ramp to Interstate 64 off Clark Street, but were blocked by police from entering the highway. Protesters then headed to police headquarters.St. Louis Police reminded protesters that blocking traffic is illegal and is not protected by the First Amendment: Per Ord. 17.16.275, it is unlawful for a person to obstruct & impede the reasonable movement of vehicular or pedestrian traffic. #STLVerdict St. Louis, MO Police September 15, 2017As the protests grew, Wells Fargo and Nestle Purina PetCare sent their nearly 7,000 employees home for the day.Police officers were seen preparing for potential riots:Bike cops are seen amassing in #DowntownSTL. #JasonStockley has been found NOT GUILTY pic.twitter.com/Kvd7aThPZe KMOV September 15, 2017Damone Smith, 52, an electrician headed to work, was among the motorists being rerouted from the protest area. I think the verdict is disgusting, said Smith, who is black. I m proud of these people protesting. If you look like me, then you feel like there is no other way to express yourself in the face of this kind of verdict. Time and time again, African American men are killed by police and nobody is held accountable. The judge explained his rationale for the verdict in a 30-page document filed about 8:30 a.m. Friday. No one promised a rose garden, and this surely is not one, he wrote of the case. This court, as the trier of fact, is simply not firmly convinced of defendant s guilt. Agonizingly, this court has pored over the evidence again and again This court, in conscience, cannot say that the state has proven every element of murder beyond a reasonable doubt or that the defendant did not act in self-defense. Because the state did not prove Stockley did not act in self-defense, Wilson wrote that he could not address lesser charges of homicide or manslaughter. St. Louis Police Department called for peace:We know emotions are running high, however we ask that those who choose to protest, do so peacefully. #STLVerdict St. Louis, MO Police September 15, 2017The fiance of the victim Anthony Lamar Smith, Christina Wilson, bravely stood in front of a microphone just prior to the court s announcement and asked for protesters to not resort to violence. Inspired by your courage, Christina. Honored to stand with you and call for peace in #STL. pic.twitter.com/4HjKvPtIwJ Eric Greitens September 15, 2017Meanwhile, on social media, people who have become famous for doing absolutely nothing but race-baiting, like Tariq Nasheed, are stirring the pot, and totally disrespecting the wishes of Smith s fiance. The unconstitutional #JasonStockley verdict is further proof that LE & the court systems have been fully infiltrated by white supremacists Tariq Nasheed September 15, 2017The Mayor of St. Louis used her opportunity to call for peaceful protests in her city to instead, stir the pot by suggesting that justice was not served, potentially leading angry protesters to believe it is now their responsibility to deliver justice:Mayor Lyda Krewson released a statement following the verdict saying, I am appalled at what happened to Anthony Lamar Smith. I am sobered by this outcome. Frustration, anger, hurt, pain, hope and love all intermingled. I encourage St. Louisans to show each other compassion, to recognize that we all have different experiences and backgrounds and that we all come to this with real feelings and experiences, she wrote.Krewson s comment drew a rebuke from Neil Bruntrager, Stockley s lawyer. How do you promote all those things by creating distrust in a system that clearly worked under these circumstances? Bruntrager said. It is irresponsible and a disservice to the community to make statements like that. It s an insult to Judge Wilson to make statements like that. And it falsely encourages the belief that an injustice was done here when in fact justice was done.

"LONDON (Reuters) - Russia poses an increasing threat and is willing to use propaganda, subversion and cyber-attacks to undermine Britain and the rest of Europe, Britain s national security adviser said on Monday. Mark Sedwill, who is overseeing a review of Britain s security services, told a parliamentary committee that Russia is attempting to sow dissension and undermine democracy in Britain and other western nations. He said the threats from Russia included from unconventional warfare such as disinformation campaigns to the dangers posed from an increase in its military capability in the North Atlantic and in Eastern Europe. We know that the Russian threat is definitely intensifying and diversifying, Sedwill said. The Russian attitude has worsened more generally towards the West and that seems set to continue. Britain has been more vocal in recent weeks about the threat posed by Russia at a time when there is growing concern among some members of the ruling Conservative party about the impact of cuts to defense spending. Prime Minister Theresa May last month in her most outspoken attack on Russia accused the country of meddling in elections and planting fake stories in the media. The head of Britain s armed forces said last week trade and the internet are at risk of damage from any Russian attack on underwater communications cables that could disrupt trillions of dollars in financial transactions. Sedwill accused Russia of planting fake stories in the media about the conduct of soldiers in Eastern Europe, where NATO troops are based to undermine the legitimacy of them being there. He also accused Russia of meddling in the recent French elections even though he said this had no chance of changing the outcome of the vote. It clearly was designed to undermine the citizen s trust in their systems and we see quite a lot elsewhere, he said.",1,fakenewsnet,,"UK sees growing threat from Russian propaganda, cyber-attacks"
"The Republican race towards the White House is getting more terrifying by the day. We have the front-runner, Donald Trump, saying at his rallies that not only does he want his crowd of supporters to be violent towards protesters, but he s also saying that he ll pay their legal fees. Now, we have Ted Cruz, who s currently in second place, saying that he ll back Trump unless he were to shoot someone.Cruz, while being interviewed Monday and asked if he s still sticking to his loyalty pledge to back the Republican nominee, said: Well, I can give you one example where I would no longer support Donald Trump. If, for example, he were to go out on Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, I would not be willing to support Donald Trump. Cruz is referring to when Trump said that his supporters love him so much, he could even shoot someone in the middle of Fifth Avenue and they would still love him.When pressed on the subject of violence at Trump rallies by a reporter and if he has reconsidered his pledge due to recent developments, Cruz insisted that he ll still back Trump. Cruz said: I know it is a shocking concept to member of the media. A shocking concept that an elected official actually does what he said. At the outset of this campaign I committed, I will support the Republican nominee, and I honor my word. This clearly shows Cruz s inflexibility on evolving situations, and proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that he does not belong in the White House. Being president includes being able to gather and process to information and intelligence and make the best decision for the nation depending on that information.Honestly, if people are still voting Republican at this point we should question their sanity. We literally have the top Republican presidential candidate encouraging violence against others, and the next in line saying he ll back that sort of behavior, unless, of course, he were to actually shoot somebody. We, as Americans, should not only be ashamed, we should be terrified that one of these men has a very real shot at being leader of the free world.Here s the video via Raw Story:Featured image via video screen capture",0,fakenewsnet,, Watch Cruz Insanely Admit He’ll Still Back Trump Until He ‘Shoots Somebody’ (VIDEO)

He then slapped at a mosquito on his podium and screamed, I DON T LIKE MOSQUITOES. I don t like those mosquitoes, I never did. Speaking of mosquitoes, oh hello Hillary how are you doing, he concluded, before moving on to another topic.Republicans have noted that instead of squeezing some mileage out of the critical FBI press conference on Hillary Clinton s emails, Trump has stumbled from one controversy to the next. First his campaign tweeted anti-semitic imagery about Clinton that they deleted, then he praised Saddam Hussein at a campaign rally, and has now appointed himself the bug-hunter-in-chief.Trump s problem appears to be that he is relying on the headline-grabbing antics of his campaign that worked so well for him against the Republican field. But in the general election, against a candidate in Hillary Clinton who doesn t have to pander to racists, the bombastic Trump style is appearing more and more like a dud.And Trump s antics easily ally him with an existing frame for his campaign that has been exploited by Democrats. Both Clinton and President Obama have invoked the need for a steady hand over the launch codes for America s nuclear launch codes, and contrasted that need to Trump s public rhetoric.The candidate clearly believes he can wing it on the way to the White House, but general election audiences are not nearly as enraptured with Trump s antics as Republicans were.Featured image via Twitter",0,fakenewsnet,, MUST WATCH: This Trump Video May Prove He’s Finally Lost His Mind

"SEOUL/TOKYO (Reuters) - South Korean and Japanese jets joined exercises with two supersonic U.S. B-1B bombers above and near the Korean peninsula on Thursday, two days after North Korea sharply raised tension by firing a missile over Japan. The drills, involving four U.S. stealth F-35B jets as well as South Korean and Japanese fighter jets, came at the end of annual U.S.-South Korea military exercises focused mainly on computer simulations. North Korea s actions are a threat to our allies, partners and homeland, and their destabilizing actions will be met accordingly, said General Terrence J. O Shaughnessy, Pacific Air Forces Commander, who made an unscheduled visit to Japan. This complex mission clearly demonstrates our solidarity with our allies and underscores the broadening cooperation to defend against this common regional threat. North Korea has been working to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the United States and has recently threatened to land missiles near the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam. On Monday, North Korea, which sees the exercises as preparations for invasion, raised the stakes in its stand-off with the United States and its allies by firing an intermediate-range missile over Japan. On Thursday, its official news agency, KCNA, denounced the military drills in traditionally robust fashion, calling them the rash act of those taken aback by the missile test, which it described as the first military operation in the Pacific. President Donald Trump, who has warned that the U.S. military is locked and loaded in case of North Korean provocation, reacted angrily to the latest missile test, declaring on Twitter that talking is not the answer to resolving the crisis over North Korea s weapons programs. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was quick on Wednesday to stress that a diplomatic solution remained possible, but on Thursday he told reporters he agreed with Trump that Washington should not be talking right now to a nation that is firing missiles over the top of Japan, an ally. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders reiterated at a regular briefing on Thursday that all options - diplomatic, economic and military - remained on the table. Japanese Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera spoke to Mattis by telephone and agreed to keep putting pressure on North Korea in a visible form, Japan s defense ministry said. Japanese Prime Shinzo Abe said he and visiting British Prime Minister Theresa May agreed to urge China, North Korea s lone major ally, to do more to rein in North Korea. May and Abe also discussed the possibility of adopting a new U.N. Security Council resolution on North Korea, a British government source said. The 15-member U.N. Security Council on Tuesday condemned the firing of the missile over Japan as outrageous and demanded that North Korea halt its weapons programs. But the U.S.-drafted statement did not threaten new sanctions. Japan has been urging Washington to propose new Security Council sanctions, which diplomats said could target North Korean laborers working abroad, oil supplies and textile exports. However, diplomats expect resistance from Russia and fellow veto-wielding power China, particularly given that new measures were only announced on Aug. 5 after North Korea tested its first two intercontinental ballistic missiles in July. A U.S. ban on travel by Americans to North Korea comes into effect on Friday, a step announced after the death of a U.S. student shortly after his release from a 15-year prison sentence in the country, where three other Americans are still detained. China repeated a call on Thursday for restraint by all parties. Defence ministry spokesman Ren Guoqiang told a monthly briefing China would never allow war or chaos on the Korean peninsula, its doorstep, and military means were not an option. China strongly demands all sides to exercise restraint and remain calm and not do anything to worsen tensions, Ren said, adding that Chinese forces were maintaining a normal state of alert along the North Korean border. Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the situation on the peninsula was serious. The current tense situation on the peninsula isn t a screenplay or a video game, she told reporters. It s real, and is an immense and serious issue that directly involves the safety of people from both the north and south of the peninsula, as well as peace and stability of the entire region.

During an interview on ABC s This Week, Brazile told George Stephanopoulos that Trump is the same person today as he was in 2005 when the appalling tape was recorded. You can draw a straight line between what Donald Trump said in 2005 and what he s been saying every day on the campaign trail over the last year and a half, she said on Sunday. This is not a changed man. This is who Donald Trump truly is. The DNC chair listed a few of the previous offensive remarks Trump has made on the campaign trail and pointed to these as more examples that confirmed Trump has not changed. He was and is a revolting human being. When you criticize a judge simply because of his Mexican heritage. When you call women some of the most disgusting things. When you criticize John McCain. When you criticize people who are disabled. This is who Donald Trump truly is. Brazile doesn t seem surprised by this newest tape from the past. After all, this is someone who is accused of raping a 13-year-old child. With everything Trump has done, bragging about grabbing women by the p*ssy is exactly the kind of thing you would expect to come out of his mouth. But what is surprising is that after everything Republicans have turned a blind eye to over the past few years, it is now that they are finally disgusted by Trump.

"Two white guys living in a state where 96% of its residents are white, and who have become extremely wealthy by selling ice cream to the rich, want everyone to know how much they support diversity by marketing over-priced ice cream with diverse labels to more rich people Ben & Jerry s announced Tuesday that proceeds from its newest flavor of ice cream, Empower Mint, will help benefit the North Carolina NAACP s campaign to repeal the state s voter ID law. Ben Cohen, Jerry Greenfield and North Carolina NAACP President Rev. William Barber kicked off a voter registration drive at North Carolina Central University in Durham on Tuesday to help marshal support against a new North Carolina law requiring voters to present a photo ID before they vote.Proceeds from the sale of the new flavor will also go toward the organization s effort to get big money donations from corporations and wealthy elites out of politics. This flavor will benefit the North Carolina NAACP, an organization dedicated to ensuring the political, educational, social and economic equality of rights of all persons and eliminating racial hatred and discrimination, the ice cream company wrote in a statement on its website. It just felt really good to be working with all these people here in North Carolina, who ve been struggling to get back their right to vote for them and other people of color, said Ben Cohen.Campaigning against voter suppression is not something we get to do in Vermont, because they re so white, he added, chuckling. This flavor, Jerry Greenfield said, helps us connect with Ben & Jerry s fans as we work nationally on trying to help reauthorize the voting rights act. Right now we have a government that represents rich white people, Cohen added. That s not what s it s about. We ve got to overturn these laws. Ben & Jerry s Ice Cream was founded in 1978.

"BEIRUT/DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran warned the United States against designating its Revolutionary Guards Corp as a terrorist group and said U.S. regional military bases would be at risk if further sanctions were passed. The warning came after the White House said on Friday that President Donald Trump would announce new U.S. responses to Iran s missile tests, support for terrorism and cyber operations as part of his new Iran strategy. As we ve announced in the past, if America s new law for sanctions is passed, this country will have to move their regional bases outside the 2,000 km range of Iran s missiles, Guards commander Mohammad Ali Jafari said, according to state media. Jafari also said that additional sanctions would end the chances for future dialogue with the United States, according to state media, and issued a stark warning to American troops. If the news is correct about the stupidity of the American government in considering the Revolutionary Guards a terrorist group, then the Revolutionary Guards will consider the American army to be like Islamic State all around the world particularly in the Middle East, Jafari said. The Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) are Iran s most powerful internal and external security force. The Quds Force, the IRGC s foreign espionage and paramilitary wing, and individuals and entities associated with the IRGC are on the US list of foreign terrorist organizations, but the organization as a whole is not. Iran sees the Sunni Muslim militants of Islamic State as an existential threat to the Islamic Republic where the majority of the population are Shi ites. On June 7, Islamic State claimed an attack on Tehran s parliament and the mausoleum of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic, killing 18 people. The Guards fired missiles at Islamic State bases in Syria on June 18 in response. Guards commanders have framed their military involvement in Iraq and Syria, where they are fighting to support the government of President Bashar al-Assad, as a fight against Islamic State. Dozens of members of the Guards, including senior commanders, have been killed in Syria and Iraq. The website for state TV reported Jafari as adding that the United States was mistaken if it thought it could pressure Iran into negotiating on regional issues. Jafari also said that Tehran would ramp up its defense capabilities, including its missile program, if the U.S. undermined a nuclear deal between Iran and Western powers. Under the 2015 deal, Iran agreed to limit its disputed nuclear program in return for the easing of economic sanctions. However, Trump is expected to announce soon that he will decertify the deal, a senior administration official has said, in a step that potentially could cause the accord to unravel. The Americans should know that the Trump government s stupid behavior with the nuclear deal will be used by the Islamic Republic as an opportunity to move ahead with its missile, regional and conventional defense program, Jafari said, according to state media. The prospect of Washington backtracking on the deal has worried some of the U.S. allies that helped negotiate it, especially as the world grapples with another nuclear crisis in the shape of North Korea. If Trump does not certify that Iran is in compliance, the U.S. Congress will have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions waived under the deal. U.N. inspectors have verified Iranian compliance with the terms. The Guards navy was also carrying out a military exercise on Sunday in the Gulf, an area of tension with the U.S. navy in recent months. More than 110 vessels were involved in the exercise, including some that have rocket and missile capabilities, a state media report quoted a Guards commander as saying.",1,fakenewsnet,,Iran warns U.S. against imposing further sanctions

"SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea has reportedly replaced guards and fortified a section of its border with South Korea where a North Korean soldier defected last week, while South Korean and U.S. soldiers have been decorated for their role in the defector s rescue. The North Korean defector was shot and wounded by his fellow soldiers as he dashed into the South Korean side of the Joint Security Area (JSA) last week. The South Korean and U.S. soldiers who led a rescue attempt to drag the gravely injured soldier to safety have been awarded medals, according to U.S. Forces Korea. A group of senior diplomats based in Seoul visited the JSA on Wednesday morning where they saw five North Korean workers digging a deep trench in the area where the soldier had dashed across the line after getting his jeep stuck in a small ditch, a member of the diplomatic delegation told Reuters on Friday. In a photograph of the visit posted to the Twitter account of acting U.S. ambassador to South Korea, Marc Knapper, North Korean workers could be seen using shovels to dig a deep trench on the North Korean side of the line as soldiers stood guard. The workers were being watched very closely by the KPA guards, not just the two in the photo, but others out of shot behind the building, said the diplomat, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the situation. According to an intelligence official cited by South Korea s Yonhap news agency, the North has replaced the 35-40 soldiers it had guarding the JSA at the time of the incident. We re closely monitoring the North Korean military s movement in the JSA, a South Korean defense ministry official told reporters, without confirming the reduction in border guards. There are limits as to what we can say about things we know. Reuters was unable to independently verify the reports, although photos taken by Knapper and other diplomats of soldiers guarding the area where workers were digging the trench showed them dressed in slightly different uniforms to the ones usually worn by North Korea s JSA guards. Two new trees had also been planted in the small space between the ditch and the line with the South, the diplomat told Reuters, in an apparent effort to make it more difficult for would-be defectors to drive across the ground. Meanwhile, in South Korea, U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) said it had awarded its own JSA soldiers - three South Korean and three U.S. soldiers - the Army Commendation medal in recognition for their efforts in rescuing the defector. The medals were personally handed out by USFK Commander Vincent Brooks in a ceremony on Thursday, according to USFK s Facebook page. The soldiers had been responsible for dragging the wounded North Korean soldier to safety in a daring rescue seen in security camera footage released by the United Nations Command earlier this week. Pyongyang has not commented on the defection of its soldier, who is now in stable condition despite sustaining multiple injuries sustained from gunshot wounds to his arm and torso. The young soldier, known only by his family name Oh, is a quiet, pleasant man who has nightmares about being returned to the North, his surgeon told Reuters on Thursday.

"HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba is willing to talk with the United States about human rights, its top diplomat for U.S. relations said on Thursday in reference to a historic visit by U.S. President Barack Obama set for March. The White House earlier said Obama would raise Washington’s concerns about rights to free speech, free assembly and independent civil society during his two-day Cuba trip, the first by a sitting U.S. president since 1928. “Cuba is open to speak to the U.S. government about any topic, including human rights,” Josefina Vidal, director of U.S. affairs for the Cuban Foreign Ministry, told reporters after the White House said Obama would travel to Cuba on March 21-22. The trip follows the two countries’ move in 2014 to reopen ties after more than 50 years of hostile relations. But Vidal made clear that Cuba’s idea of what constituted human rights did not coincide with Washington’s perception. “We have different ideas (about rights), in the same way that different ideas exist about other topics like democracy, political models and international relations, she told reporters. “We hope that President Obama will have the opportunity to converse with the real Cuban civil society,” Vidal said, using a term to draw a distinction from the opposition, which the government considers illegitimate. Cuba says critics of its human rights record overlook a low crime rate and guaranteed healthcare and education. Obama will meet with dissidents when he visits Cuba, the White House said. Republicans complained that the trip would lend legitimacy to the island’s Communist government. Anti-government activists face harassment and short-term detention if they gather and protest in Cuba. The Cuban Commission of Human Rights and National Reconciliation, a dissident group, says there has been a spike in such detentions since November. Cuba released 53 political prisoners around the time of rapprochement in December 2014. But there are still about 90 political prisoners in Cuba, the commission said on Thursday, an increase of about 20 since it issued its annual report in June 2015. The Cuban government see the dissidents as a tiny minority with little public support and financed indirectly by Washington.",1,fakenewsnet,,"Ahead of Obama visit, Cuba says ready to talk about rights"

"Last week, RABA Research had Hillary Clinton beating Donald Trump in a general election match-up by 15 points, gaining 10 points on the GOP presidential candidate after a strong showing at the Democratic National Convention.RABA s poll was considered a complete outlier, given most other polls (whether they be from Reuters, CNN, Fox, Ipsos) had Clinton beating Trump by 6 to 10 points.But now a second poll has come out that may put RABA back into the mainstream.A McClatchy-Marist poll has given Hillary Clinton a 15 point lead over Donald Trump (48-33), and a 14 point lead when factoring in third party candidates (45-31). So even with spoilers, Clinton blows Trump out of the water.What s even more fascinating is the McClatchy-Marist poll shows Clinton with an 8 point lead among men, and a 23 point lead among those who identify as moderates. Clinton is also viewed as more presidential than Trump by 14 points (53-39).When it comes to who can best handle the War on Terror, immigration, gun violence, trade and jobs, Clinton bests Trump in EVERY category, by a margin of 4-21 points.While Clinton gained in Democratic support, going from 83 percent to 90 percent, Trump lost among Republicans, going from 85 percent to 79 percent.So Jill Stein isn t siphoning off Clinton supporters, but it would appear Gary Johnson may be gaining with Trump supporters. I guess those in the Never Trump camp are aplenty while those in the Never Hillary are almost non-existent.Wasn t Trump supposed to be the great unifier? He s losing members of his own party, and quickly (remember, the RNC was only two weeks ago).In fact, 57 percent of people voting for Clinton are voting for her, more or less, because of her, whereas 40 percent are doing it to spite Trump. On the other side, only 36 percent of Trump supporters are voting for the billionaire because they like him, while 57 are voting for him to spite Clinton.So Trump s voters don t really like him all that much. Clinton s voters? They sure do.This poll is not an outlier. It s the second one showing Secretary Clinton with a monumental lead.

"Republicans repeatedly tell us our schools would be safer if we put guns in the hands of teachers so they can defend our precious little snowflakes from any and all threats. But sometimes, you have to wonder what would have happened had a gun been introduced to a situation especially if the threat in question is the educator the GOP wants to arm.Mary Hastings, a 63-year-old teacher at Ozen High School in Texas, was arrested for assault Friday after horrifying video surfaced showing her beating an African-American student. Hastings, who is white, can be seen (apparently) accusing the student of interfering with another student s graduation. She then calls the boy idiot ass as she throws the unnamed (and most importantly, noncombative) African-American student s papers off of his desk and hits him in the head repeatedly. When he asks why she did that, she mocks him because that s apparently what adults do these days.Hastings was removed from the classroom and placed on paid administrative leave. She was released on $2,500 bond and slapped with a misdemeanor assault charge. In a statement, Beaumont Independent School District s Special Assistant to the Superintendent, Nakisha Burns, explained that the teacher would be terminated and vowed that such abuse would not be tolerated:The Beaumont Independent School District can confirm that an Ozen High School teacher was arrested today for physically assaulting a student. The conduct was substantiated by video footage viewed by BISD police and administration. The District is committed to providing a safe and secure environment for our students. BISD does not condone employees abusing any child and will not tolerate such conduct. The teacher was immediately removed from the classroom and placed on administrative leave pending action on her contract.If this is the sort of person the GOP wants to arm, it is certainly a chilling thought.

"Trump s economic adviser, Gary Cohn, has bought into the GOP s tax plan lock, stock and barrel to the point where he likely has a deep belief that trickle-down economics actually works. The thing is, it doesn t, and at a Wall Street Journal event packed full of CEOs, Cohn seemed absolutely stunned that this crowd of corporate leaders wouldn t automatically say they d use the GOP s tax cuts to invest in their own companies.An editor from the Wall Street Journal asked the audience: If the tax reform bill goes through, do you plan to increase investment your company s investment, capital investment? Only a few of them raised their hands indicating they would. Cohn s response was: Why aren t the other hands up? Really? Well, yes, really. It seems so easy to Cohn, apparently. One might even think that he genuinely doesn t understand why most of the CEOs in the room kept their hands down. Cohn now looks incredibly ignorant and stupid.Corporate tax cuts do not result in greater capital investment and these CEOs know it. Anybody who knows anything about business and economics (and even modern history) knows it. It s really quite simple: CEOs will not invest in things like new machinery, new factories, or new jobs when they don t have enough customer demand to justify it.In fact, most money saved from these kinds of tax cuts go toward stock buybacks, which is a controversial practice in which a company buys back its own stock to artificially drive prices up and put more money into the pockets of shareholders and the C-suite. CEO pay also tends to go up when taxes go down.CEOs know this. They want the tax cuts for precisely this reason. Their greed has gotten the best of them and they know tax cuts will make them richer. But they can t, and won t, commit to using the money they ll save on taxes to expanding operations and creating jobs because if they do, they create a PR nightmare for themselves.Watch Cohn get shocked below:1.

"INCHEON, South Korea (Reuters) - LPGA chief Mike Whan says the Tour will back golf authorities no matter what decision they make about hosting the 2017 US Women’s Open at a course owned by presidential nominee Donald Trump amid a storm over sexually aggressive comments he made about women. The United States Golf Association (USGA) is facing calls to move the event from Trump National Golf Club in New Jersey in nine months’ time after a 2005 video surfaced in which he bragged of kissing and groping women without consent. Whan told Reuters in an interview on Saturday at the LPGA/KLPGA co-sanctioned KEB Hana Bank Championship in Incheon that he was “lucky” not to have to make that kind of decision. The U.S. Women’s Open, the most prestigious tournament in ladies golf, is conducted by the USGA. “In a strange way I’m lucky that the LPGA has no direct dealings with Donald Trump or Donald Trump properties,” he said. “Like any group we have people who are political in favor of different sides. I’m not here to be a politician, I know that what the players want is that I don’t get so political as to limit opportunities for women. “All I’ve said to the USGA is this, ‘You have long since proven you support women’s golf so if you tell us this is the right place to play then we’re right there with you.’” Whan took over in 2010 when the LPGA Tour was buckling from the fallout of the U.S. recession and his push for global growth has been a key factor in the circuit’s resurgence. One look at his business card tells you everything you need to know about his strategy for growing the women’s game — the word “commissioner” emblazoned in English, Korean, Chinese and Japanese. Whan said he hoped the global flavor of the Tour’s schedule and sponsorship could help mitigate the effects of another downturn at home. “In the world of finance we have a pretty diverse portfolio,” he said of a tour which makes stops in China, Japan, Malaysia, Korea and Taiwan in a late season Asian swing. More than a third of the circuit’s tournaments are sponsored by Asian firms or organizations. “It used to be that one U.S. economic downturn could really cripple the LPGA,” he added. “I’m not saying that wouldn’t happen tomorrow, but generally speaking we are pretty well diversified regionally.” Whan said now that the Tour had been put on a solid footing, with 33 official money events this year compared to 23 in 2011, the task was to boost the dollar value of tournaments rather than add new ones. “I think we need to be playing for $100 million in purse money,” he said of future targets. “I said that back in 2010 and people thought I was nuts, but that was when we were playing for $30 million. “Now we’re play for $65 million and I think we’ll get there.” The decision to add a fifth major to the annual tour schedule, the Evian Championship, was met with scorn by traditionalists and those outside the LPGA but Whan said it would be a mistake to be stuck in the past. “Sports that are unwilling to change because of history and tradition become historic and traditional,” he added. “If we just want golf to be historic and traditional and not move forward, then we would have a real problem.”",1,fakenewsnet,,LPGA happy to let USGA make Trump course decision

"Fox News is collapsing like a house of cards as the fallout over rampant sexual harassment continues.Gretchen Carlson got the ball rolling when she filed a lawsuit against the conservative network, accusing Fox boss Roger Ailes of sexually harassing her and punishing her for refusing to have sex with him.Rather than stand by their colleague, however, Fox hosts such as Greta Van Susteren and others took Ailes side instead.But now that Carlson has been vindicated and Ailes forced to resign, Van Susteren now regrets not believing the victim in the first place.In a post on Facebook on Friday, Van Susteren opened up about Carlson and expressed regret for not believing Carlson from the start. I read Geraldo s FB post in which he said he regretted not believing Gretchen Carlson s claim of sexual harassment, she wrote. We all regret it I made my regret self evident in my GretaWire posting about 3 weeks ago which ended with this: Gretchen, you go girl. That said it all. Van Susteren continued by admitting that it was unfair for her to judge the case since she was 200 miles away from where the harassment took place and that she had never talked to Carlson about it to hear her side of the story personally. It is indeed true, when I read the complaint written by lawyers I never spoke to Gretchen as she was long gone from Fox I found it inconsistent with what was my experience and information at the Fox News Channel, admittedly working 200 miles from the scene of the crimes. It was hidden from all of us. Van Susteren left Fox News earlier this week and they replaced her with Brit Hume, a man who has spewed sexist remarks on the air for years.And now that she is no longer employed by Fox News, Van Susteren has absolutely no problem shaming her former employers for not doing anything about Roger Ailes sooner. But I have regrets beyond Geraldo s and beyond not believing a civil complaint written by lawyers. I regret that Roger Ailes was not supervised by those in a public corporation who had the duty to supervise him.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s team has canceled an appearance before Congress by his nominee for defense secretary, retired General James Mattis, regarding a waiver he needs for the post, congressional officials said on Wednesday. The U.S. House of Representatives had been due to hear Mattis testify on Thursday and he had agreed to appear. Mattis, who retired from the Marine Corps in 2013, is technically ineligible to be defense secretary since he has not been a civilian for at least seven years. That means Congress would need to grant a waiver, something it has not done since 1950. House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer said it was his understanding the Trump transition team had blocked Mattis from testifying. Congressional aides also confirmed that Mattis had agreed to testify but the appearance had been blocked. The decision appeared to be part of an effort to keep the attention on Mattis’ confirmation hearing in the Senate, which is scheduled for earlier on Thursday. “This (waiver) is not a minor issue. This is a major issue affecting the principle of civilian control of the military, and Ranking Member (Representative Adam) Smith believes deeply that General Mattis should come speak with the members about it,” said Barron Youngsmith, a spokesman for Democrats on the House Armed Services Committee. A Trump transition team spokeswoman did not speak directly to the House hearing but said Mattis’ current focus was on the Senate confirmation process and “testifying at his confirmation hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee.” “If confirmed he looks forward to working with both the Senate and House Armed Services Committees, which play critical roles in supporting our forces and ensuring civilian control of the military,” Alleigh Marre said in a statement. Hoyer said Mattis might be the best of the nominees for top administration positions put forward by the Republican Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20. Republicans control the Senate, so Mattis is expected to be confirmed if he receives the appropriate waiver. The Senate and House must both agree to exempt him from a law written when the Department of Defense was created to ensure that the U.S. military is under civilian command. Senators expressed little opposition to Mattis’ appointment at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on civilian control of the military on Tuesday, as the panel considered whether to issue the waiver. Outside experts testified. Senator John McCain, the Senate panel’s chairman, said he would “fully support” the waiver legislation, which is expected to pass Congress. Mattis, 66, has been warmly received by senior defense figures among both Republicans and Democrats, who believe he will adhere to core alliances and principles, even ones challenged by Trump during his election campaign.",1,fakenewsnet,,Trump's team blocks U.S. House appearance by Pentagon pick: officials

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Tuesday won the endorsement of evangelical Christian leader Jerry Falwell Jr. for the party’s 2016 presidential nomination, the Trump campaign said. Falwell, the president of Liberty University in Virginia and son of late televangelist Jerry Falwell Sr., picked Trump because he believes the billionaire businessman could “lead our country to greatness again,” the campaign said in a statement. Trump has been vying with his chief rival, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, for the evangelical vote as the nomination race nears its first contest, the Iowa caucuses, on Monday. On Tuesday, Trump celebrated the endorsement on Twitter. “Great honor- Rev. Jerry Falwell Jr. of Liberty University, one of the most respected religious leaders in our nation, has just endorsed me!” tweeted Trump, who is a Presbyterian. The endorsement came a week after Falwell introduced Trump before a speech he gave at the Christian university. In his introduction, Falwell said he saw similarities between Trump and his father, including a penchant to “speak his mind.” Trump’s speech at the university was not without controversy. Trump was criticized by many evangelicals for mistakenly referring to a book of the Bible as “Two Corinthians” instead of “Second Corinthians.” Critics said the misstep called into question Trump’s Christian credentials. Cruz, the son of a Baptist preacher, made a joke of his opponent’s flub during a speech on Monday with a riff on an old Chrysler auto commercial: “Two Corinthians walk into a bar - Ah, yes, Ricardo Montalban - genuine Corinthian leather!” (Reporting by Megan Cassella; Additional reporting by Amy Tennery and Eric Beech; Editing by Doina Chiacu and Jonathan Oatis) SAP is the sponsor of this coverage which is independently produced by the staff of Reuters News Agency.",1,fakenewsnet,,Falwell Jr. endorses Trump for U.S. president: campaign statement

"Trump s latest fiasco is so bad that it s bleeding over into other GOP presidential campaigns. Not only that, but there s every reason to think this could land on House and Senate Republicans in 2016 as well. You can see the perfect example of it already happening in the videos below.It all started with Trump saying, during a town hall interview with Chris Matthews, that he feels there should be a punishment for women who get abortions. This is how he suggests you enforce a theoretical law that would either ban abortion altogether or punish certain abortions that happen outside of limitations like rape and incest.The backlash to this came swiftly from pro and anti-abortion advocates alike. Despite both sides disavowing it, though, the damage to Republicans has already been done. Now, Republicans other than Trump ones who bragged hugely about how they would do everything they can to ban abortion in an effort to out-pro-life each other are being asked a very uncomfortable question while the cameras are rolling; What kind of punishments would you seek for women who get abortions? Here is the first of two reasons why this might be the worst thing to happen to the Republican party since reacts to Trump s abortion comments: Of course, women shouldn t be punished for having an abortion MSNBC March 30, 2016Remember, John Kasich is the grown up in the room and he can t even answer the freakin question properly. How would you punish women is not answered by there s exceptions for rape, unless you think literally every pregnancy is caused by rape in America, which I doubt he does. And, admitting you wouldn t punish them is going to political suicide.But wait, it gets even worse.Here is how it will go down. Republican voters finally heard a Republican presidential candidate say they would actually go after women who get abortions with criminal penalties . This is the answer to their prayers literally. Now the smell of blood is in the air and Republicans will not take no for an answer to the question of will you punish women who get abortions? Below is the second reason and a perfect example of the sh*tstorm that Trump has started:Trump may have single-handedly taken the entire pro-life movement to a place from where it won t easily be able to recover. Logically speaking, it s difficult to ban a thing without criminal penalties associated with violating the ban. Republican voters want sooooo badly for there to be criminal penalties for women who murder babies along with the doctors and whoever else they can blame for it. The logical outcome of this is obvious.In the space of one day being pro-life was made uncool for Republicans. Now you need to be pro-punishment to satisfy your rabid voter base.

"PRISTINA (Reuters) - A Kosovo journalist known for his investigative stories on corruption and crime was beaten in a crowded caf bar in central Pristina on Friday. Vehbi Kajtazi runs the news website Insajderi that has become one of the must trusted online media for its investigative reporting into allegations of corruption and crime among Kosovo s top officials. Local media have shown photos of him with blood on the forehead. The Kajtazi attack came just two months after the other Insajderi editor, Parim Olluri, was beaten up in the late evening as he was going home with his fianc e. I have identified the attacker and he attacked me because of the stories that I write, Kajtazi told Reuters.

"When hatred takes human form, it looks a lot like the founder and chairman of the Liberty Counsel Mathew Staver. You may recognize him as the lawyer for the infamous Kentucky County Clerk Kim Davis who refused to do her job because her hatred was too big a burden to bear so she chose prison instead. She just couldn t stand the thought of two loving people of the same gender getting married, so she showed us just a taste of what was about come in terms of hating the LGBT community. And she had Staver as her equally bigoted lawyer.What s come since Davis hissy fit has been a string of anti-LGBT bills disguised as religious freedom laws, and Staver is the man behind the hate nationwide. CBS News investigated and came to find out that it s been Staver leading this zealous crusade. From laws prohibiting transgender individuals from using the proper bathroom to allowing businesses the right to refuse service to the LGBT community, Staver has been there through it all. Yet, he cleverly words his hatred as such: It is only about being free to pursue your faith. We have no interest in discriminating against anyone. No, Staver, the First Amendment already guarantees your freedom to pursue your faith, what you re doing is helping states all across the nation write laws to specifically discriminate against LGBT individuals. You are making it legal to deny service or evict tenants based on sexual orientation. This legislated hate is taking away the freedom of LGBT citizens to grant the freedom to legally discriminate to religious zealots afraid gay money has gay cooties. And God forbid a transgender person needs to pee.Oh, and get this, Staver doesn t think businesses are really going to pull out of the states that have enacted these laws. He s supposedly calling their bluff. He s about to be in for a rude awakening, because being on the wrong side of history has never boded well for any bigot. His hatred for the gay community is bizarre. If he wants freedom, live and let live.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is now the leading candidate to become President-elect Donald Trump’s secretary of state, but even some Republicans say his tough-guy personality and global business ties may be at odds with international diplomacy. Giuliani, 72, has been one of Trump’s most vocal and high-profile supporters, and according to sources close to him and Trump, he is eager to become the top U.S. diplomat and expects a decision by Trump as early as next week. The other top candidate, the sources said, is former United Nations Ambassador John Bolton, a foreign policy hawk. New York mayor at the time of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks by al Qaeda militants, Giuliani is also considered a hard-liner on national security matters, but he has little diplomatic experience. Still, some prominent Republicans said he is qualified to take command of U.S. diplomacy at a time of chaos in the Middle East, rising nationalism in much of Europe, and growing challenges from Russia and China. Senator Lindsey Graham, a respected conservative voice on defense and foreign policy who serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee and who made a rather short-lived bid for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, on Tuesday called Giuliani “competent and capable” of being secretary of state. “Rudy is an internationally-known figure. He’s a personal friend. He has dealt with the unimaginable, which was 9/11. He’s a loyal supporter of President Trump. He should be rewarded in my view,” Graham told reporters. Giuliani himself extolled his foreign policy credentials in an interview with Fox News Channel’s Sean Hannity on Tuesday. “I’ve been in 80 countries, 150 different foreign trips,” Giuliani said. “A lot of it for different reasons. Speeches. Security consulting, where I helped bring down crime.” Critics, however, said they are troubled not only by Giuliani’s combative nature and lack of experience, but also by his international business ties and his lucrative speaking engagements for an Iranian exile group that was on the U.S. terrorism list until four years ago. The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment on its consideration of Giuliani for secretary of state. After serving as New York mayor for eight years, Giuliani founded management and security consulting firm Giuliani Partners in 2002, which he left in 2007 when he campaigned for the Republican presidential nomination and questions were raised about his foreign business ties. The firm’s clients have included Colombia and, reportedly, the government of Qatar. Giuliani appears to have resumed work with the firm after his 2007 failed presidential bid, and is listed as chairman and chief executive officer of Giuliani Partners on the Giuliani Security and Safety website. He joined a Texas law firm as a name partner in 2005. The firm did lobbying work for Citgo, a U.S. subsidiary of Venezuela’s state-owned oil company, which at the time was controlled by President Hugo Chavez, Venezuela’s late socialist ruler. At the time, Giuliani’s office said he was not personally involved in the lobbying and said Giuliani believed that “Chavez is not a friend of the United States.” Giuliani’s dealings in Russia may face scrutiny in Senate confirmation hearings. His ties to TriGlobal Strategic Ventures, a consulting firm that helps Western clients advance their business interests in emerging markets of the former Soviet Union, date back to 2004, when Giuliani visited Moscow to meet Russian businessmen and politicians, according to the company’s website. The consulting firm’s president, Vitaly Pruss, has “created and developed strategies” for companies including Russian oil pipeline monopoly Transneft and has “worked closely” with Giuliani Partners, according to his profile on TriGlobal’s website. State-owned Transneft was among Russian oil companies targeted with sanctions by Western powers following Russia’s annexation of Crimea under President Vladimir Putin. Giuliani also has spoken in support of the People’s Mujahedin Organization of Iran, a group of Islamic leftists who opposed Iran’s late shah, but fell out with the Shi’ite clerics who took power after the 1979 revolution and later aligned itself with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. The U.S. government considered it a terrorist organization until 2012. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, who also was a contender for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, told CNN on Tuesday he was worried about Giuliani’s ties to foreign governments. “Whether or not you have divided loyalties obviously is very important,” Paul said. “I hope Donald Trump will pick somebody consistent with what he said on the campaign trail - Iraq war was a mistake, regime change in the Middle East is a mistake. “You want to have a diplomat in charge of diplomacy,” he said. Critics, however, say the bottom line is that Giuliani is no diplomat, either personally or professionally. “The challenge for Giuliani if he becomes secretary of state would be to move beyond the tough guy persona he cultivated as prosecutor and mayor and instead stand up for some of the basic principles of human rights, democratic accountability, and the rule of law that enhance rather than shrink America’s influence abroad,” said Ken Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, who worked for Giuliani when he was a federal prosecutor between 1983 and 1987.",1,fakenewsnet,,Top U.S. diplomat role an unlikely fit for 'tough guy' Giuliani

"Peace through strength President Donald Trump raised the stakes with Iran again this morning by dashing off a tweet.The tweet comes a day after the new president dramatically raised the possibility of military action against Iran over its missiles test on Thursday saying nothing is off the table amid news that a new round of sanctions could be coming within hours. Sources told the Associated Press that up to two dozen Iranian individuals, companies and possibly government agencies could be penalized as part of the move.Action could come as early as later Friday, said the officials and others with knowledge of the decision. The individuals weren t authorized to discuss the unannounced sanctions publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.Gen. Michael Flynn told reporters during a White House press briefing that the administration condemns such actions by Iran that undermine security, prosperity and stability throughout and beyond the Middle East that puts American lives at risk. As of today, we are officially putting Iran on notice, he said.Trump used the phrase when asked directly if military action was possible, and after a series of angry tweets about how the Islamic republic tested a ballistic missile something the nuclear bargain it struck with Barack Obama explicitly forbids. It also emerged Thursday that Iran has tested a cruise missile called Sumar that is capable of carrying nuclear weapons. The development was reported by German newspaper Die Welt reported Thursday, citing unspecified intelligence sources.Trump s personal involvement began earl on Thursday morning when he used social media to issue an explicit warning to Tehran.Trump has been openly hostile to the terms of the Obama-Tehran nuclear deal, saying during his presidential campaign that it was stupid, a disgrace, and the worst deal ever negotiated. His tweets likely stand as the first time a head of state has used social media to threaten a foreign country. They were met with contempt by the Iranian regime.A top adviser to the Iranian supreme leader said the country will not yield to useless US threats from an inexperienced person over its ballistic missile program.Ali Akbar Velayati said, who is a senior counsel to Iran s most powerful man Ayatollah Ali Khamenei hit back. This is not the first time that an inexperienced person has threatened Iran, he said. The American government will understand that threatening Iran is useless. The report of a cruise missile test in the German newspaper said the Sumar cruise missile was built in Iran and traveled around 375 miles in its first known successful test.The missile is believed to be capable of carrying nuclear weapons and may have a range of 1,200 to 1,800 miles, the paper said, citing intelligence sources.Cruise missiles are harder to counter than ballistic missiles since they fly at lower altitudes and can evade enemy radar, confounding missile defense missiles and hitting targets deep inside an opponent s territory.But the biggest advantage from Iran s point of view, a security expert told Die Welt, was that cruise missiles are not mentioned in any United Nations resolutions that ban work on ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear weapons.There has been no explicit response from Iran or from Washington on the cruise missile disclosure.However, Trump s National Security Advisor had issued his own stern warning to Tehran s mullahs on Wednesday.

"PARIS (Reuters) - France s foreign ministry said on Wednesday it was taking accusations by the United States that Iran had violated two U.N. Security Council resolutions seriously and urged Iran to comply with all its international commitments. The United States Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley accused Iran on Tuesday of supplying Yemen s Houthi rebels with a missile that was fired into Saudi Arabia in July and called for the U.N. to hold Tehran accountable for violating two U.N. Security Council resolutions. We take these American indications seriously and attach utmost importance to Iran s compliance with all of its international obligations, including the weapons transfer bans provided for in UN Security Council Resolutions 2216 and 2231, deputy foreign ministry spokesman Alexandre Georgini told reporters in a daily briefing. He did not respond when asked whether Paris supported potential measures at the Security Council. France s Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian has said that he expected a challenging meeting with his Iranian counterpart in Tehran when he travels there later this month. He is due to discuss Iran s ballistic missile program, which Paris says goes against U.N. Security Council resolutions, and its regional activities. We have deep disagreements with Iran (on the ballistic issue) ... and the way in which Iran is discreetly or through proxies trying to create a direct channel to the Mediterranean, he said after a Security Council meeting at the United Nations on Oct. 31.",1,fakenewsnet,,France says takes U.S. claims Iran violated U.N. resolutions seriously

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Pakistan s foreign minister on Thursday described as hollow allegations comments by senior U.S. officials and lawmakers during his visit to Washington this week that questioned Islamabad s resolve in fighting militancy. President Donald Trump s administration is seeking to implement its regional strategy. While U.S. officials have long been critical of the role Pakistan has played in Afghanistan, senior officials have been more pointed in recent days about Islamabad s alleged support for militant groups. Earlier this week, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said the United States would try one more time to work with Pakistan in Afghanistan before Trump would take whatever steps are necessary to change Pakistan s behavior. On Tuesday, the top U.S. military officer said he believed Pakistan s main spy agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) directorate, had ties to the militant group. You want us to sniff them out, we will do that. You want us to take action against them, whatever action you propose, we will do that... (but) these hollow allegations are not acceptable, Pakistan s Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif told a group of reporters. In August, Trump outlined a new strategy for the war in Afghanistan, chastising Pakistan over its alleged support for Afghan militants. Reuters first reported that possible Trump administration responses being discussed include expanding U.S. drone strikes and perhaps eventually downgrading Pakistan s status as a major non-NATO ally. Asif singled out Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Service Committee, saying the senator was playing to his constituents when he criticized Pakistan. We are not saying we are saints. Perhaps in the past, we made some mistakes. But since the last three, four years, we are wholeheartedly, single mindedly, we are targeting these terrorists, Asif said. Asif said that Pakistan had less influence over the Taliban than in previous years, which could impact any efforts for peace talks to bring an end to the war in Afghanistan. He added that U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson would be visiting Pakistan later this month.",1,fakenewsnet,,Pakistan's top diplomat pushes back on U.S. claims of militant support
"One has to wonder why in the world people would support Ted Cruz. His policies are the essence of Republican backwardness and even members of his own party don t like him. In addition, he s lied throughout his campaign for the Republican nomination. Yet, Cruz is still hanging in there for the nomination. In fact, he s actually enjoying a surge as of late as Republican voters try to figure out who is less worse, Donald Trump, or creepy Ted Cruz. Cruz appears to have found a niche as Republicans have to vote for Cruz as the alternative to Trump.Yet, who are these voters that are now siding with Cruz as he surges in the polls? Samantha Bee sums it all up when she took down Ted Cruz s appalling group of supporters on her show Full Frontal. First, there s Colorado pastor Kevin Swanson, who appears in a video clip (see below) saying, Homosexuals are worthy of death to which Bee commented, Wow, For a guy who hates gay people, Swanson s got some fabulous dance moves. Then there s the reverend Flip Benham, who was convicted of stalking an abortion doctor and was part of a protest where people chanted, Jesus hates Muslims. Bee declared, In your face Donald Trump, Cruz supporters hated Muslims before it was cool. Not to be outdone, there s pastor Mike Bickle, who is the poster child for anti-Semitism. Bickle declared: The lord said I m going to give all 20 million of them the chance to respond to the fisherman and if they don t respond to grace, I m going to raise up the hunters and the most famous hunter in recent history is a man named Adolph Hitler.

The crowd booed and hissed at the media on Saturday as well as Trump complained that the media is somehow treating him unfairly because they report on what he says.As usual, Trump to his temper tantrums in real world to Twitter, where he fired off several tweets on Sunday morning and afternoon all about how the dishonest media is in the bag for Hillary Clinton.The failing @nytimes talks about anonymous sources and meetings that never happened.

"This copy of the Antifa Manual, that is used by the George Soros funded, violent, anti-American, anti free-speech radical group, was allegedly found on the Evergreen College campus. The content of this manual is disturbing and should be read by every American, so we understand what we are up against. It helps to explain why these groups call our President and his supporters Hitler or racists or homophobes. It s not that Trump or his supporters are any of these things, it s just part of a campaign to humiliate and shut down any opposition to radicals whose ultimate goal is a one world order and the destruction of capitalism in America. This manual gives every day Americans a look into the mind of a leftist radical who hates America and everything Americans stand for. They clearly have no regard for free-speech and are willing to use any means necessary, including deceit, outright lies and of course, violence to achieve their ultimate goals of a New World Order.This page explains how Antifa members are to use name-calling as a means to create a culture of tolerance. When all else fails, compare someone to Hitler. Next they discuss how to use ones minority status, and to remember that you are Black first and American second. or Gay/Lesbian first and American third and so on.It s important to gain control of the media through any means necessary.Some major media conglomerates are swinging to our side, but they have not gone far enough.It s no coincidence that CNN just published a fluff piece on Antifa today: Unmasking the leftist Antifa movementThe CNN piece was clearly written to shed a sympathetic light on the violent group that s been caught attacking and harming so many innocent Americans, many of them were harmed by Antifa for defending free speech and/or our President Donald J. Trump.Look for the leftist media to kick it into high gear when it comes to defending the violence perpetrated on innocent Americans by the violent Antifa group. More of these soft pieces on the radical Antifa group are sure to be popping up over the next several months.If you are seeking positions of power in the media, be sure to obfuscate and hide your true intentions on the various social media platforms.Use social media as a baton to slap down anyone who hold fascist viewpoints. Call them racist, homophobic, misogynistic. Create an echo chamber around you.The next step is to threaten the livelihood of anyone who dares speak out against our agenda.The pro-abortion page: This page talks about how white people are able to afford to have their fetuses aborted, while people of color have little choice but to keep a baby to term.And finally, the ultimate goal is a New World Order and a New World Government where hatred and bigotry no longer exist. Imagine, if Antifa could figure out a way through George Soros funded activity, to shut down the rights of every American using violence and hatred at tools, their dream might just be possible until they wake up and realize of course, that most Americans don t hate this country and aren t interested in Antifa s special brand of violence and chaos.",0,fakenewsnet,,ANTIFA MANUAL FOUND On Evergreen College Campus: Shut Down Their Rallies…Force The Media To Show Our Side As The Righteous One

His brother, Ariel Diaz, 24, was charged with unarmed robbery, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, indecent assault and battery, kidnapping and witness intimidation.He was deported to Guatemala in May 2014 after convictions for drunken driving and disorderly conduct, said Neudauer.Another brother, Adan Diaz, 32, and Marlon Josue Jarquin-Felipe, 27, are both charged with indecent assault and battery and kidnapping. All four suspects are from Guatemala. Jarquin-Felipe was deported back to his homeland in April 2014, according to Neudauer.Neudauer told the Herald yesterday the agency is closely monitoring the cases and has placed detainers on all four illegal immigrants. He added that Ariel Diaz was also arrested this winter on a drunken driving charge.

The US will be unable to protect and promote democracy in the rest of the world. On the contrary, Trump will have greater affinity with dictators. That will allow some of them to reach an accommodation with the US, and others to carry on without interference. Trump will prefer making deals to defending principles.

"MUNICH (Reuters) - U.S. Republican senators plan to introduce legislation to impose further sanctions on Iran, accusing it of violating U.N. Security Council resolutions by testing ballistic missiles and acting to “destabilise” the Middle East, a U.S. senator said Sunday. “I think it is now time for the Congress to take Iran on directly in terms of what they’ve done outside the nuclear program,” Senator Lindsey Graham, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told the Munich Security Conference. Graham said he and other Republicans would introduce measures to hold Iran accountable for its actions. Tensions between Tehran and Washington have risen since an Iranian ballistic missile test that prompted U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration to impose sanctions on individuals and entities linked to the country’s Revolutionary Guards. “Iran is a bad actor in the greatest sense of the word when it comes to the region. To Iran, I say, if you want us to treat you differently then stop building missiles, test-firing them in defiance of U.N. resolution and writing ‘Death to Israel’ on the missile. That’s a mixed message,” Graham said. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif told the conference earlier on Sunday that Iran did not respond well to sanctions or threats. James Jones, a former Supreme Allied Commander in Europe and President Barack Obama’s first national security adviser, told a separate event in Munich that he remained convinced that sanctions had persuaded Iran to negotiate the 2015 landmark deal with six world powers to curb its nuclear program. “The sanctions did work. Iran would never have come to the negotiating table without sanctions,” Jones said. “This is a new form of response that if properly utilized can change behavior and get people to do things that they otherwise wouldn’t do.” Senator Christopher Murphy, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told the same panel there was nothing preventing Congress from imposing sanctions beyond those that were lifted as a result of the 2016 nuclear agreement with Iran. Murphy, a Democrat, said had backed the nuclear deal in the explicit understanding that it would not prevent Congress from taking actions against Iran outside the nuclear issue. “There’s going to be a conversation about what the proportional response is,” Murphy said, referring to Iran’s missile test. “But I don’t necessarily think there’s going to be partisan division over whether or not we have the ability as a Congress to speak on issues outside of the nuclear agreement.” Murphy said the United States needed to decide whether it wanted to take a broader role in the regional conflict. “We have to make a decision whether we are going to get involved in the emerging proxy war in a bigger way than we are today, between Iran and Saudi,” he said.",1,fakenewsnet,,Senators look to new sanctions against Iran for missile development

"(This November 15 story was corrected to clarify in paragraph three that not all people evacuated were fighters) ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey on Tuesday said it was appalled by the approach of the U.S. Department of Defense towards an agreement between the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia and Islamic State to withdraw Islamic State militants from the Syrian city of Raqqa. Last month, a YPG militia spokesman said that Syrian Islamic State fighters were set to abandon Raqqa in a withdrawal agreed with U.S.-backed Syrian militias. On Sunday, a report by the BBC said some 4,000 people, including hundreds of foreign nationals, had been evacuated from Raqqa as part of the agreement and spread across Syria and as far as Turkey. Seeing that statements from the spokespeople of the international coalition against Islamic State and the U.S. Department of Defence have not denied the existence of the given agreement, but to the contrary said they respected it is appalling, Turkey s Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Ankara has been infuriated with Washington over its support of the YPG militia, seen by Turks as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has fought a decades-long insurgency in Turkey and is designated a terrorist group by Ankara, the United States and European Union. The ministry said the withdrawal of Islamic State militants from Raqqa was extremely troubling , and added that it was a development that should be noted . The agreement in question has become an example that if a battle is carried out with a terrorist organization, those terrorist organizations will eventually opt to cooperate with each other, it said.

"HARARE (Reuters) - Inside State House in Harare, Robert Mugabe was in the tightest spot of his 37-year rule. Tanks were on the streets and troops had occupied the state broadcaster, from where the army had announced it had taken control of Zimbabwe. Mugabe, 93 years old but still alert, remained defiant. The only leader the country had known since independence was refusing to quit. At a tense meeting with his military top brass on Nov. 16, the world s oldest head of state put his foot down: Bring me the constitution and tell me what it says, he ordered military chief Constantino Chiwenga, according to two sources present. An aide brought a copy of the constitution, which lays out that the president is commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Chiwenga, dressed in camouflage fatigues, hesitated before replying that Zimbabwe was facing a national crisis that demanded military intervention. Mugabe retorted that the army was the problem, according to the sources present. Then the beleaguered president indicated that perhaps they could find a solution together. The meeting marked the start of an extraordinary five-day standoff between Mugabe and Zimbabwe s supreme law on one side, and the military, his party and Zimbabwe s people on the other. The generals wanted Mugabe to go, but they also wanted a peaceful coup, one that would not irreparably tarnish the administration aiming to take over, according to multiple military and political sources. The president finally accepted defeat only after he was sacked by his own ZANU-PF party and faced the ignominy of impeachment. He signed a short letter of resignation to parliament speaker Jacob Mudenda that was read out to lawmakers on Nov. 21. Mugabe, who had run Zimbabwe since 1980 and overseen its descent into economic ruin while his wife shopped for luxury goods, was gone. The country erupted into ecstasy. Parliamentarians danced and people poured onto the streets in their tens of thousands to celebrate a political downfall that sent shockwaves across Africa and the world. To many, the end of Mugabe had been unthinkable only one week before. Reuters has pieced together the events leading up to Mugabe s removal, showing that the army s action was the culmination of months of planning that stretched from Harare to Johannesburg to Beijing. Drawing on a trove of intelligence documents from within Mugabe s feared Central Intelligence Organization (CIO), Reuters reported in September that the army was backing Emmerson Mnangagwa, then vice president, to succeed Mugabe when the time came. The report detailed how Mnangagwa, a lifelong friend and former security chief of Mugabe, might cooperate with Mugabe s political foes in order to revive the economy. It caused furore in Zimbabwe s media and political circles. Bitter rivalry intensified between Mnangagwa and Grace, Mugabe s 52-year-old wife, who also hoped to take over as president and had the backing of a ZANU-PF faction known as G40. In early October, Mnangagwa said he had been airlifted to hospital in South Africa after a poisoning attempt in August. He pointed no fingers - but he didn t need to. Grace s swift response was to deny it and accuse her rival of seeking sympathy; she belittled him as nothing but an employee of her husband, according to a report in the state-run Herald newspaper. As the pressure built, Mugabe became increasingly paranoid about the loyalty of army chief Chiwenga, a career soldier and decorated veteran of Zimbabwe s 1970s bush-war against white-minority rule. Mugabe s spies, who permeated every institution and section of society in Zimbabwe, were warning him the military would not accept Grace as president. Mugabe is very worried of a coup, one intelligence report, dated Oct. 23, said. Mugabe was openly told by senior CIOs that the military is not going to easily accept the appointment of Grace. He was warned to be ready for civil war. Reuters reviewed the document, and hundreds of other intelligence reports dating back to 2009, before the coup took place. The documents come from within the CIO, but Reuters could not determine for whom they were written. The CIO is split into factions, some pro- and some anti-Mugabe. In late October, Mugabe summoned Chiwenga to a showdown, according to another of the documents, dated Oct. 30. It said Mugabe confronted the army chief about his ties to Mnangagwa and told him that going against Grace would cost him his life. Chiwenga was warned by Mugabe that it is high time for him to start following. He mentioned to Chiwenga that those fighting his wife are bound to die a painful death, the intelligence report said. At the same meeting, Mugabe also ordered Chiwenga to pledge allegiance to Grace. He refused. Chiwengwa refused to be intimidated. He stood his ground over his loyalty to Mnangagwa, the report said. Reuters put questions about this exchange and other aspects of this article to Mugabe s spokesman, George Charamba. In an enigmatic text message dated Nov. 23, he replied: Enjoy Reuters copy. Goodnight. Two spokesmen for Chiwenga declined to comment. After another tense meeting with Mugabe on Nov. 5, Chiwenga left Harare on a pre-arranged official trip and traveled to China, which wields significant influence as a major investor in Zimbabwe. A day later, Mugabe sacked Mnangagwa as vice president and purged him from ZANU-PF, the liberation movement that Mnangagwa had served since his youth and for which, as a young militant caught bombing a train, he had nearly been executed. For the generals, Mugabe had gone too far. The military immediately activated a Code Red alert, its highest level of preparedness, a military source said. Moments after Mnangagwa was ousted on Nov. 6, the security details assigned to him and his house were withdrawn, according to a statement he issued later. He was told his life was in danger. Security personnel, who are friendly to me, warned me that plans were underfoot to eliminate me once arrested and taken to a police station, Mnangagwa said in a Nov. 21 statement. It was in my security interest to leave the country immediately. From Harare, he managed to escape over the border into neighboring Mozambique, where he caught a plane to China, according to one source familiar with his movements. There he met up with Chiwenga, the source said. Reuters could not confirm the account; but an intelligence report from Nov. 13 indicates that Mugabe suspected some of his generals of preparing to overthrow him from China. A number of generals are now in China ready to plot Mugabe s ouster with Mnangagwa, the report said. It was not clear which generals, and whether their travel to China was authorized. Mugabe s spies suspected old allies had turned against the aging president. An intelligence report, dated Oct. 30, said Beijing and Moscow both supported regime change out of frustration at Zimbabwe s economic implosion under Mugabe. China and Russia are after change, the report said. They are after change within ZANU-PF as they are sick and tired of Mugabe s leadership. The two countries are even ready to clandestinely supply arms of war to Mnangagwa to fight Mugabe. Neither China s Defense Ministry nor Foreign Ministry responded to a request for comment. The Foreign Ministry had previously said Chiwenga s visit was a normal military exchange mutually agreed upon by China and Zimbabwe. Reuters sent written requests for comment to the Kremlin, the Russian Defense Ministry and the Russian Foreign Ministry. None of them responded. China has long taken an interest in Zimbabwe, having supported Mugabe s forces during the liberation struggle. After independence it developed connections there in mining, security and construction. Russia has also had ties to Zimbabwe since the early 1980s, and in 2014 a Russian consortium entered into a partnership to develop a $3 billion platinum mining project in the country. Chiwenga s trip to China culminated in him meeting Chinese Defense Minister Chang Wanquan in Beijing on Nov. 10. Two sources with knowledge of the talks told Reuters that Chiwenga asked if China would agree not to interfere if he took temporary control in Zimbabwe to remove Mugabe from power. Chang assured him Beijing would not get involved and the two also discussed tactics that might be employed during the de facto coup, the sources said. Reuters could not establish whether Mnangagwa met Chang. Having got wind of the talks in China, Mugabe summoned his still-loyal police commissioner, Augustine Chihuri, and his deputy, Innocent Matibiri, to detain Chiwenga on his return to Harare, government and security sources said. The pair assembled a squad of 100 police and intelligence agents. But the plot leaked and Chiwenga supporters managed to pull together a counter-team of several hundred special forces soldiers and agents as their commander s plane approached. Some were disguised as baggage handlers, their military fatigues and weapons hidden beneath high-visibility jackets and overalls, one security source said. Realizing they were outnumbered and outgunned, Chihuri s police team backed down, allowing Chiwenga to touch down without incident, the security source said. Mugabe s spokesman did not comment on the incident. Two days later, Chiwenga and a group of military commanders demanded a meeting with Mugabe at his official State House residence in Harare, an ornate colonial villa complete with stuffed leopards and thick red carpets, according to a government source. They said they were very alarmed at the firing of Mnangagwa and told Mugabe to rein in his wife and her G40 faction, whom they accused of trying to divide the military, according to the government official, who was present at the discussions. What do you think should be done? Mugabe demanded of the soldiers as he sat slumped in an armchair. The generals asked him to give assurances that they too would not be purged. Mugabe s response was lukewarm, the government source said. Chiwenga told Mugabe he would be making his concerns about the G40 faction public. Hours later, Chiwenga summoned reporters to the military s main barracks near Harare to issue a statement. We must remind those behind the current treacherous shenanigans that, when it comes to matters of protecting our revolution, the military will not hesitate to step in, he said, reading from a prepared text. The following afternoon, Reuters reported six armored personnel carriers heading towards the headquarters of Mugabe s Presidential Guard on the outskirts of Harare. It was unclear whose command they were under. At the time, the city s residents were on edge but still unsure what it all meant. At around 6 p.m. on Nov. 14, Mugabe s motorcade headed to his private Blue Roof residence, a heavily fortified compound in the capital s leafy northern suburb of Borrowdale. Meanwhile, social media buzzed with pictures of armored vehicles driving along roads to Harare, sparking frenzied speculation about a coup. Increasingly concerned, Grace put in a call shortly after 7 p.m. to a cabinet minister asking to get WhatsApp and Twitter shut down, according to one source familiar with a recording of the conversation. The minister, whose identity Reuters is withholding for safety reasons, replied that such a move was the responsibility of state security minister Kembo Mohadi. No-one will stand for a coup. It cannot happen, said Grace, commonly referred to as Amai, which means Mother, according to a source who heard the recording. Mugabe s voice is then heard on the line: As you have heard from Amai, is there anything that can be done? The minister gave the same response, about the responsibilities of state security, and the line went dead, the source said. Mohadi declined to comment. Two hours later, two armored vehicles rolled into the Pockets Hill headquarters of the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC), according to ZBC sources. Dozens of soldiers sealed off the site and stormed into the studios where they accosted staff, snatching their phones and halting programs. State-owned ZBC, widely seen as a mouthpiece for Mugabe, switched to broadcasting pop music videos. Mugabe s inner circle, nearly all of them G40 loyalists, had no idea what was under way, according to four sources familiar with their conversations. Information Minister Simon Khaya Moyo called Defense Minister Sydney Sekeramayi to ask if he had any information about a possible coup. Sekeramayi said no, but tried to check with military chief Chiwenga. Chiwenga told Sekeramayi he would get back to him. According to the sources, Chiwenga never did. Moyo remains in hiding and was unavailable for comment. Sekeramayi declined to comment. As ministers in the G40 faction tried frantically to work out what was going on, Chiwenga s men closed in on Mugabe s compound. According to a source briefed on the situation, Albert Ngulube, a CIO director and head of Mugabe s security detail, was driving home around 9.30 p.m. after visiting Mugabe. He met an armored car on Borrowdale Brooke, a side road leading to Mugabe s house. When Ngulube confronted the soldiers and threatened to shoot them, they beat him up and detained him, the source said. Ngulube was later released, but had suffered head and facial injuries, the source added. Spokesmen for Chiwenga and Mnangagwa declined to comment. Reuters was unable to contact Ngulube. Other G40 ministers were also picked up by soldiers. Finance minister Ignatius Chombo was found hiding in a toilet at his house and beaten before being detained at an undisclosed location for more than a week. On his release on Nov. 24, he was hospitalized with injuries to his hands, legs and back, his lawyer told Reuters, describing the army s behavior as brutal and draconian. Soldiers used explosives to blow the front door off the house of Jonathan Moyo, the main brains behind G40, according to video footage of the house seen by Reuters. Others burst through the front gates of the residence of local government minister Saviour Kasukuwere, another key Grace supporter. Both men managed to escape to Mugabe s residence. Contacted by Reuters shortly after midnight in the early hours of Nov. 15, Kasukuwere was audibly stressed. I can t talk. I m in a meeting, he said, before hanging up. For another week, Mugabe clung on to the presidency as Chiwenga and his forces tried to engineer a peaceful, and quasi-legal, exit for the long-serving leader. But as parliament began impeachment proceedings on Nov. 21, Mugabe finally gave up. After 37 years in control, during which much of his country fell into poverty, his letter of resignation said he was stepping down out of concern for the welfare of the people of Zimbabwe.",1,fakenewsnet,,Special Report: 'Treacherous shenanigans' - The inside story of Mugabe's downfall

"In an email sent on April 15, 2011, our upstanding Attorney General Eric Holder wrote: Issa and his idiot cronies never gave a damn about this when all that was happening was that thousands of Mexicans were being killed with guns from our country. All they want to do in reality is cripple ATF and suck up to the gun lobby. Politics at its worst maybe the media will get it. Holder was also involved in the IRS scandal that targeted conservatives and conservative leaning organizations. He was never held accountable.What s truly shocking however, was Holder s involvement in the Trayvon Martin case in Sanford, Florida. While he was acting as our nation s Attorney General, he was caught by Judicial Watch spending our taxpayer dollars to deploy a little-known unit of the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Community Relations Service (CRS) to Sanford, FL, following the Trayvon Martin shooting to help organize and manage rallies and protests against George Zimmerman. Holder was also present in Ferguson where he did absolutely nothing to stop the rioting and chaos.Set up under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the DOJ s CRS, the employees of which are required by law to conduct their activities in confidence, reportedly has greatly expanded its role under President Barack Obama. Though the agency claims to use impartial mediation practices and conflict resolution procedures, press reports along with the documents obtained by Judicial Watch suggest that the unit deployed to Sanford, FL, took an active role in working with those demanding the prosecution of Zimmerman.On April 15, 2012, during the height of the protests, the Orlando Sentinel reported, They [the CRS] helped set up a meeting between the local NAACP and elected officials that led to the temporary resignation of police Chief Bill Lee according to Turner Clayton, Seminole County chapter president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. The paper quoted the Rev. Valarie Houston, pastor of Allen Chapel AME Church, a focal point for protestors, as saying They were there for us, after a March 20 meeting with CRS agents.Separately, in response to a Florida Sunshine Law request to the City of Sanford, Judicial Watch also obtained an audio recording of a community meeting held at Second Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church in Sanford on April 19, 2012. The meeting, which led to the ouster of Sanford s Police Chief Bill Lee, was scheduled after a group of college students calling themselves the Dream Defenders barricaded the entrance to the police department demanding Lee be fired. According to the Orlando Sentinel, DOJ employees with the CRS had arranged a 40-mile police escort for the students from Daytona Beach to Sanford.Once again, Eric Holder was never held accountable for this horrendous act that was the catalyst for Obama s race war. The impact Eric Holder had in dividing our nation by race and the hate he inspired towards our law enforcement, can never be underestimated.For entire story including detailed payments go to: Judicial WatchAs a side note, in 2013, House members introduced a resolution to impeach Eric Holder, Jr., Attorney General of the United States, for high crimes and misdemeanors:Sets forth articles of impeachment stating that Holder: (1) engaged in a pattern of conduct incompatible with the trust and confidence placed in him in that position by refusing to comply with a subpoena issued by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on October 12, 2011, in connection with a congressional investigation into Operation Fast and Furious by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF); (2) failed to enforce multiple laws, including the Defense of Marriage Act, the Controlled Substances Act, and the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986; (3) failed his oath of office by refusing to prosecute individuals involved in the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) scandal of unauthorized disclosure of tax records belonging to political donors; and (4) testified under oath before Congress on May 15, 2013, that he was neither involved in nor had heard of a potential prosecution of the press but later confirmed to the House Judiciary Committee in a letter dated June 19, 2013, that he approved of a search warrant on journalist James Rosen.Of course he was never impeached and as recently as yesterday was threatening Americans that Obama was going to start becoming more public with his anti-Trump rhetoric",0,fakenewsnet,,"STUNNING STORY The Media And Democrats Hid From Public: How OBAMA’S AG Eric Holder Used TAXPAYER Dollars To Organize Street Mobs Against George Zimmerman, Take Down Police Chief"

"Misogyny is ingrained in people from the time they are born Taylor Swiftmi sog y ny m s j n /Submit noun dislike of, contempt for, or ingrained prejudice against women. Becoming friends with Lena without her preaching to me, but just seeing why she believes what she believes, why she says what she says, why she stands for what she stands for has made me realize that I ve been taking a feminist stance without actually saying so, she said at the time.Taylor Swift has decided to use her platform as Maxim magazine s June cover girl to address feminism, and says her music is unfairly categorized as whiny because of society s systematic misogyny.The 25-year-old singer, who has won seven Grammy s and is worth an estimated $200 million, explained to the men s publication why she believes there is a double standard when it comes to how others analyze her music. A man writing about his feelings from a vulnerable place is brave; A woman writing about her feelings from a vulnerable place is oversharing or whining, she said. Misogyny is ingrained in people from the time they are born. So to me, feminism is probably the most important movement that you could embrace, because it s just basically another word for equality, she added.The seemingly impressionable mega star, who hadn t previous identified as a feminist, told the Guardian last August how one of her closest friends, Lena Dunham, put it into perspective for her.Approximately two months after she spoke to the Guardian, Swift told David Letterman how empowering Dunham was, while explaining how the two became friends. She direct messaged me, and she said We need to be best friends. I feel like you ve been my best friend in my head for months and almost years now. So, I need to see you in person; then I will lavish you with complements in person, Swift recounted.Fortune Magazine named Swift as the world s most influential female leader in March, citing her savvy business nature.While Swift speaks of a double standard surrounding her music, it has yet to affect her album sales or stop her from selling out two or three stadium shows every week.Just this past Sunday, the Shake it Off singer nabbed eight recognitions at the Billboard Music Awards, including top female artist, top artist, top Billboard 200 artist, top Billboard 200 album, top streaming song, and top Hot 100 artist.Watch: Taylor Swift Likes Lena Dunham- David Letterman was supposed to be Her Year has in fact turned out to be five-alarm disaster for Lena Dunham, the creator of HBO s Girls. A year ago, closing out 2014 had to look pretty exciting to the 28 year-old. No matter how good or bad it was, her memoir would be released to guaranteed critical acclaim (she is Lena Dunham after all), there were two major Golden Globe nominations, and the publicity surrounding the 4th season premiere of Girls was going to be bigger than anything anyone could have ever imagined.2014 was going to be Dunham s breakthrough; the year she went mainstream. Along with the gushing reviews of her memoir and slavish coverage from The New York Times, there would be countless magazine covers, talk show appearances, and a thousand slathering articles obsessing over her every tweet and utterance. The entertainment media was on board. The mainstream media was on board. And at first it all went according to plan.Things went so well there was even talk of Lena Dunham starring in a Ghostbusters remake. You don t get any more mainstream than that. And you certainly don t get any more mainstream than having a best friend forever like Taylor Swift.Then, in three words, it all fell apart: Hypocrisy, lies, children. Hypocrisy: Dunham demanded people vote then it was discovered she did not vote.Lies: Dunham claimed in her non-fiction memoir that she had been raped in college by a campus Republican named Barry. She lied. And in the process indicted an innocent family man as her alleged rapist. Worse, Dunham and her publisher Random House stood silent for two months even after they knew the memoir had placed a cloud of suspicion over an innocent man.While attempting to run to Dunham s defense, Gawker tripped over itself and was forced to report their belief that Dunham s alleged rapist is wait for it, wait or it a Democrat.No one is questioning whether or not Dunham was raped. Something no one else is questioning, though, is that her behavior in this matter was breathtakingly selfish and craven.Children: Dunham s unnatural sexual behavior towards her much younger sister creeped everyone in America out not named Jimmy Kimmel.Those are just the top 3. The Wrap dug up 3 more PR disasters. The mainstream media desperately tried to save Dunham from herself, especially the cowardly and wildly dishonest Savannah Guthrie and Bill Simmons.

"PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodia s main opposition party will boycott a parliamentary vote to strip their detained leader of immunity on Monday and will instead go to Kem Sokha s jail to demand his release, one of his deputies said on Sunday. Kem Sokha, the head of the Cambodian National Rescue Party (CNRP), was arrested a week ago and charged with treason for allegedly plotting to win power with the support of the United States, escalating a crackdown on critics of Prime Minister Hun Sen and independent media ahead of a general election next year. Two aid groups run by the publisher of the Cambodia Daily, shut a week ago in a dispute over a crippling tax bill, said they were suspending work after their accounts were frozen. Parliament is due to vote on whether to remove the immunity from prosecution which Kem Sokha gets as an elected member of parliament. The ruling Cambodian People s Party s (CPP) majority means the motion is certain to pass anyway. CNRP deputy leader Mu Sochua said the parliament vote was illegal. We can t accept this. We will demand that Kem Sokha, who has not done anything wrong, be released, she said, adding members of parliament would hold a protest at the prison where he is being held near the border with Vietnam. CPP spokesman Sok Eysan said the opposition boycott would be unconstitutional, but the CPP had enough votes to strip Kem Sokha of his immunity anyway. Hun Sen, a 65-year-old former Khmer Rouge commander, has ruled Cambodia for more than 30 years and said last week he planned to stay in power for another decade. Next year s election had been expected to be his toughest electoral test, but Western countries and human rights groups have raised doubts as to whether the vote will be fair. They have criticized Kem Sokha s arrest, but China has given its backing to close ally Hun Sen. The evidence presented against Kem Sokha so far is a video recorded in 2013 in which he discusses a strategy to win power with the help of unspecified Americans. His lawyers have dismissed the evidence as nonsense and said he was only discussing election strategy. In recent weeks, Hun Sen has also expelled the National Democratic Institute, a non-governmental organization that promotes democracy, and ordered 19 radio stations off the air. The independent English-language Cambodia Daily shut last week after being given a month to pay a $6.3 million tax demand. Japan Relief for Cambodia and World Relief for Cambodia, aid groups financed by the paper s publisher, said their accounts had been frozen and they would have to suspend building schools and teaching English and computing to thousands of pupils.",1,fakenewsnet,,Cambodian opposition party to boycott parliament vote on leader

"(Reuters) - U.S. officials should be respectful of the Mexican 2018 presidential election, Mexico’s foreign minister said on Thursday, after a top U.S. security official suggested a win by a leftist candidate would be bad for both nations. Speaking with senators on Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly agreed with Republican Senator John McCain’s view that “if the election were tomorrow in Mexico, you would probably get a left-wing, anti-American president of Mexico. That can’t be good for America.” Kelly, who was speaking at a Senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs hearing, echoed that viewpoint. “It would not be good for America or for Mexico,” he said. Though Kelly and McCain stopped short of naming anyone in particular, their comments were seen in Mexico as a clear swipe at leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a populist who many see as the frontrunning candidate in the 2018 presidential election. Speaking at a news conference in Washington on Thursday, Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray said he broached the issue with Kelly. “I told him in a respectful but clear manner that the electoral decisions ... correspond to Mexicans alone and that what we expect from the United States is respect toward the Mexican electoral process,” Videgaray said. For his part, Lopez Obrador rejected the accusation that he was “anti-American.” “Our relationship with the United States will be one of friendship and cooperation, but not one of submission. We are a free and sovereign nation,” he said according to a press release. Regarding the looming renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, Videgary said Mexico would prefer to conclude the talks this year rather than in 2018, when the Mexico’s election takes place. Some view Videgaray, a former finance minister now leading complex trade, security and migration negotiations with the Trump administration, as a possible presidential candidate in 2018 for the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party.",1,fakenewsnet,,Mexico urges respect from U.S. for 2018 presidential election

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama urged the U.S. media and American public on Friday to examine the “long record” of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and not get distracted by the “spectacle and the circus” aspect of the 2016 election campaign. The Democratic president delivered an indirect swipe at the flamboyant, combative Republican primary campaign run by Trump, a former reality television star, and how media have covered it. “It’s important for us to take seriously the statements he’s made in the past,” Obama said in remarks to reporters. “I just want to emphasize the degree to which we are in serious times and this is a really serious job. “This is not entertainment. This is not a reality show. This is a contest for the presidency of the United States.” He said Trump has a long record in public life and that should be closely examined, as should the statements and policy positions of all the candidates. “If they take a position on international issues that could threaten war or has the potential of upending our critical relationships with other countries, or would potential break the financial system - that needs to be reported on,” Obama said. Trump received criticism and angered allies with his comments on rethinking NATO and suggesting Japan and South Korea should consider getting nuclear weapons to defend themselves. He is perceived abroad as pursuing isolationist policies at odds with the current U.S. role in the world. Obama said he would be looking to see the American people are adequately informed about where candidates to replace him in the White House stand on issues, what they believe and whether their budget numbers add up. “What I’m concerned about is the degree to which reporting and information starts emphasizing the spectacle and the circus. Because that’s not something we can afford,” Obama said. “The American people, they’ve got good judgment, they’ve got good instincts - as long as they get good information.”",1,fakenewsnet,,Obama urges scrutiny of Trump's record: 'This is not entertainment'

"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany s three would-be coalition partners went deep into overtime in talks on Saturday as they sought enough common ground in climate and migration policy to form a government and stave off the prospect of a repeat election. Incumbent chancellor Angela Merkel s only realistic hope of securing a fourth term after suffering losses in September s election is an awkward three-way conservative-liberal-Green alliance. But after four weeks of talks, the parties remained far apart as they adjourned for the night. The biggest sticking points are climate change, where the Greens want emissions cuts that the other parties see as economically ruinous, and immigration, where Merkel s arch-conservative allies in Bavaria insist on stricter rules. With the pro-business, tax-cutting Free Democrat (FDP) liberals freshly returned to parliament after four years in the wilderness, and the Greens out of office for 12 years, neither is keen to give ground. A self-imposed deadline of Thursday for wrapping up exploratory talks and starting formal coalition negotiations passed without agreement, forcing the conservatives to promise further concessions on emissions cuts to the Greens. FDP leader Christian Lindner said the talks now had to be wrapped up by 1700 GMT on Sunday. But President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, a former foreign minister who now plays an apolitical role, said brinkmanship was to be expected. Before the formal talks start, there are always attempts by parties to drive prices up, he told the weekly Welt am Sonntag. What we ve seen in the past weeks isn t so different from previous coalition negotiations. Greens chairwoman Simone Peter said much that had earlier been agreed on emissions policy had been undone, without giving details. Bavaria s Christian Social Union (CSU) faces regional state elections next year, and fears the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) could unseat it after 60 years if it fails to secure tough immigration rules - which are anathema to the left-leaning Greens. Among its demands are a cap of 200,000 per year on the number of refugees Germany will take, and an end to the practice of allowing successful asylum seekers to bring their immediate families to join them. All parties are anxious to avoid a repeat election, which they fear could boost the AfD, which surged into parliament for the first time in September s national election. But the heterogeneous three-way coalition, made necessary after the conservatives and the centre-left suffered punishing election losses, is untested at national level.",1,fakenewsnet,,German parties regroup for last-ditch coalition push

"Ann Coulter, throughout her seemingly long career, has managed to offend just above every group that is not white, male or Christian (or American), although the last one is arguable. She hates African-Americans, Muslims, women, Hispanics, Latinos, Jews, Catholics, immigrants, atheists, scientists, veterans, the LGBT community, and just about everyone else. But the other day, Coulter managed to offend another group of Americans: Asians.Appearing on MSNBC s Hardball with Chris Matthews with Joy Ann Reid, the self-described Mean spirited, bigoted conservative struck again when she referred to Asian Americans supporting Donald Trump as Mandarins. And in true Coulter fashion, she insisted that it was the correct term even after being told that is was in fact not.Here s how the exchange went:ANN: You have Mandarin Chinese people with signs for Trump, Make America Great Again, written in Mandarin whether they are Hispanic or Mandarin, the ones inside the stadium are Americans and think of themselves as Americans and want the laws enforced As I said before they have Mandarins in the audience and Hispanics in the audience. JOY: What does Mandarin mean? You mean Asian American. They re called Asian Americans, Ann, not Mandarins. ANN: It has nothing to do with demographics. JOY: It s throwback language, it s not 1913. They are called Asian Americans. ANN: Anyways, as I was saying, it has nothing to do with demographics. It has to do with if you re here legally or illegally, whether you consider yourself American, whether the laws on the books are going to be enforced. We have an invasion of people who are - JOY: If your default when discussing Asian Americans is to call them Mandarins, we are not bringing back archaic language here, Ann. Just talk about people as Americans Asian Americans. ANN: No, you are not going to police my language. They are Mandarins, it is written in Mandarin. And there it is the big bad liberal is policing the poor, innocent conservative like a big old bully. Those damn liberals, not wanting to be grossly offensive and racist! How dare they!Now some people may not wholly object to this term. But for starters, it s always important to remember that not all Asians are Mandarins, also known as Chinese. When one blanket terms an entire race of people, they dismissing the importance of other cultures, ethnicities, and people of different origin, which is in itself racist. Coulter chose to brush off the importance of these people just because they are Asian (not white), by referring to them with a slur.Second, the term Mandarin was used to describe the public officials of China s imperial government, a government that has not been in place since 1912. So Coulter referring to these supposed Trump supporters as Mandarins shows just how stupid she really is, and that she really doesn t care about non-white people or their history.But then again, do any Trump supporters?Watch Ann make a fool of herself (yet again):Featured image via Stephen Lovekin/Getty Images",0,fakenewsnet,," Ann Coulter Goes Full Racist, Calls Asian Americans ‘Mandarins’ And Insists It’s O.K."

"WENZHOU, China (Reuters) - When authorities in China s southeastern city of Wenzhou outlawed Sunday School earlier this year, Christian parents determined their children must still learn about Jesus and the Bible. Churches in Wenzhou started teaching children in private homes or at other venues. Some billed Sunday School classes as daycare, not education, or moved them to Saturdays, more than a dozen local Christians told Reuters. Wenzhou, sometimes known as China s Jerusalem due to its sizable Christian community, is at the forefront of a growing standoff between China s leadership and the country s devout over religious education for children. The ruling and officially atheist Communist Party has increased efforts to curb the influence of Christianity, tightening restrictions on faith classes and warning against the religion s Western ideas. But Christians say the resolve of the community in Wenzhou suggests the party will struggle to exert control over the next generation of the country s 60 million Christians. In her house, faith comes first, grades come second, said one parent surnamed Chen, asking not to use her full name due to the sensitivity of the matter. Immaculately turned out in a cream fur coat and wearing a giant turquoise ring, Chen is one of Wenzhou s numerous wealthy Christians who say their children must attend Bible classes because state education fails to provide sufficient moral and spiritual guidance. Drugs, porn, gambling and violence are serious problems among today s youth and video games are extremely seductive, she told Reuters. We cannot be by his side all the time so only through faith can we make him understand (the right thing to do). In some districts of Wenzhou, in Zhejiang province, an official edict has prohibited Sunday Schools since August, according to three sources with direct knowledge of the matter. The provinces of Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangsu, Henan and the autonomous region of Inner Mongolia have barred children from faith activities including summer camp, Christian news site World Watch Monitor reported in September. Sources spoken to by Reuters were unaware if the policy was a local government initiative or centrally mandated. They also did not know of any similar bans in other regions of China. Also in September, new rules were released expanding state oversight of religious education nationwide in what officials say is an attempt to create a new generation of religious leaders loyal to the party. China s State Administration for Religious Affairs and the foreign affairs office of the Wenzhou city government did not reply to faxed requests for comment. In the last four decades of economic prosperity, China s faithful have multiplied rapidly. Official numbers say there are now around 30 million Christians, while independent estimates suggest the number is about 60 million, most of whom are Protestants. In Wenzhou, a small Christian community started by 19th century missionaries has bloomed to over one million Christians. Until recent years, they had enjoyed a relatively relaxed relationship with local officials, residents said. Then, in 2014, a government campaign to demolish illegal churches and tear down the crosses that adorned them sparked an outcry from the Christian community and sowed mistrust of authorities among believers. The campaign came shortly after President Xi Jinping, who had been communist party chief of Zhejiang from 2002 to 2007, was appointed General Secretary of the party. But attempts to stem the rapid growth of believers has struggled in Wenzhou where churches, often funded by devout local business owners, are ubiquitous. Wenzhou government does not let churches register, because there are way too many, so there are lots of house churches and it is tough for the government to manage them, Zhao Gang, the minister at Wenzhou s Church of the Rose-tinted Clouds, told Reuters. Sunday School textbooks have been especially sensitive in the clampdown in Wenzhou, teachers said. The government restricts religious publications, and churches often use translated texts from overseas. One teacher said classes resumed when they stopped using unsanctioned textbooks and avoided the words Sunday School . Chinese law officially grants religious freedom for all, including children, but regulations on education and protection of minors also say religion cannot be used to hinder state education or to coerce children to believe. Local governments in troubled areas of China, such as the far western region of Xinjiang, ban children attending religious events, but Christian communities elsewhere rarely face blanket restrictions. This year, the party has been unusually strict in warning university students, state-owned enterprise employees and officials themselves against celebrating Christmas, with admonitions such as to resist the corrosion of Western religious culture , according to state media reports. While parents in Wenzhou want to control their children s education, the government is working to create a new crop of religious leaders loyal to the party. New rules governing religious schools from China s cabinet, due to take effect in February, are necessary to meet China s pressing need for patriotic religious leaders, Wang Zuoan, the head of China s official State Administration of Religious Affairs, told Reuters in written comments in October. We hope that the talent graduating from religious schools will be up to standard in both their political and religious character and will do a good job of combining love for the country with love for religion, he said. But for many Christians allowing the party to control religious education is unacceptable, as it requires putting the party before God, according to Sarah Cook, a New York-based analyst at Freedom House, an advocacy group. As such, the party can only do so much to control faith education. There are always going to be kids at home whose bedtimes stories are from the Bible, Cook said. For Chen in Wenzhou, faith should be at the forefront of education until believers outnumber atheists in China s young. There will definitely be more Christian believers in the next generation, she said. The ability for the Christian faith to be inherited and passed on is ever growing.",1,fakenewsnet,,"In 'China's Jerusalem', Christians say faith trumps official Sunday School ban"

"PARIS (Reuters) - France, the European Union s largest farm producer, plans to raise regulated minimum food prices and limit bargain sales in supermarkets in a bid to increase farmers income, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said on Thursday. The move is part of a wider field-to-fork review that closed on Thursday. Farmers, an important constituency in French politics, have long complained of being hit by a price war between retailers, which has benefited consumers but hurt producers down the chain. The measures will be put in place for a trial period of two years, Philippe said. Selling at a loss is forbidden in France. To determine the minimum level at which retailers are allowed to sell a product, France has set a Resale Below Cost (RBC) threshold. The RBC threshold is currently defined by the product s basic purchase price, minus discounts, plus transport costs to the retailer s warehouse. The government will propose to raise the RBC threshold by 10 percent, Philippe said at the close of the food review. The aim is to rebalance trade relations for the benefit of farmers income, he said when describing the proposal. The rise would include some of the additional costs already supported by retailers, such as the cost of logistics and staff needed to bring products from warehouses to the shelves, food industry group Ania said. This will increase the end-price of all products sold between the current RBC threshold and the new one - but not necessarily more expensive ones. The government will propose limiting discounts on food products to 34 percent of a product s price and to 25 percent of available volumes, Agriculture Minister Stephane Travert said. This means that retailers will be able to do promotion offers such as three products for the price of two but only for a fourth of their supplies for that product. The war in prices had led to rebates of up to 70 percent, which are most often supported by food producers. The aim of the measure is to avoid consumers losing the sense of prices. It would now be promotions, not sell-offs, Christiane Lambert, head of France s largest farm union FNSEA, said. Analysts say the measures would reduce aggressive price competition among French retailers and accelerate food inflation, potentially benefiting retailers profit margins in the short-term. This should calm down the (price) game a bit but the most aggressive players on prices may be tempted to parry an attack, Raymond James analyst Cedric Lecasble said. A softer competitive climate could come as a relief for retailers like Carrefour (CARR.PA) and Auchan [AUCH.UL], whose profitability is under pressure and whose hypermarkets sales suffer from aggressive price discounting from the market s dominant player, Leclerc, Barclays analyst Nicolas Champ said. Leclerc is now the leading retailer in France with a national market share of 21 percent against 20.5 percent for Carrefour, the latest Kantar data show. Accelerated food inflation could also lead some consumers to trade down, which could benefit hard discounters like Lidl. The limitation of promotions could also benefit discounters who have mostly Every Day Low prices strategies and reduce the attractiveness of the hypermarket stores, which are more focused on promotions. The government s aim is to present draft legislation to Parliament early next year, Philippe said. Analysts say the measures are unlikely to have an impact on the food chain before the second half of 2018. Ania had estimated that a rise of 15 percent in the RBC threshold would cost consumers an average of 30 cents ($0.36) per person and per week. Prices of products currently sold lower than the new RBC floor level - mostly products used to attract consumers such as Ferrero s Nutella or Coca Cola (KO.N) soft drinks - would rise mechanically. The government hopes that the measures will prompt retailers to loosen pressure on suppliers and food makers who would then pass at least part of the rise onto farmers. But some are doubtful that this will happen. We will increase some products prices by 10 percent, promising that miraculously this money, taken from consumers, will go down to the agri-food industry and that industry will give this money back to farmers. By what miracle, we do not know, there are no tools, Olivier Andrault from consumer rights group UFC-Que choisir told Europe 1 radio. The government will also reinforce the so-called renegotiation clause that allows parties to ask that contracts - concluded on an annual basis in France - be reviewed if there is a large swing in production prices. To ensure that farmers are not paid below their costs, France also plans to reverse the process of determining prices by taking farmers production costs as the starting point.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former President Barack Obama used a rare public appearance on Wednesday to question Republicans’ latest effort to repeal his signature healthcare law, saying it would inflict “real human suffering” on Americans. In his speech at a Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation event in New York City, Obama also laid out an optimistic vision of the world’s future while implicitly criticizing Republican President Donald Trump’s “America First” philosophy. The remarks were one of the few times that Obama, a Democrat, has spoken publicly since he left office in January. “It is aggravating,” Obama said of the Republican attempt to eliminate Obamacare. “It’s certainly frustrating to have to mobilize every couple of months to keep our leaders from inflicting real human suffering on our constituents.” But Obama said the healthcare fight was a good example of the way that advancement is often made: through fits and starts, with backward steps tempering every success. “Progress is never inevitable,” he said. “It can often be fragile; it’s in need of constant renewal.” The true test, he said, was in how people respond in times of difficulty, when their efforts to make the world better run into resistance. “Your response has to be to reject cynicism and reject pessimism and to push forward with a certain infectious and relentless optimism,” he said. “Not blind optimism, not one that ignores the scale and the scope of challenges, but that hard-earned optimism that is rooted in the stories of very real progress that have occurred throughout human history.” The speech came a day after Trump addressed the United Nations General Assembly for the first time as president, offering a full-throated defense of nationalism and expressing skepticism about multilateral foreign policy. During a question-and-answer session with Bill and Melinda Gates after his speech, Obama said the United States cannot hope to solve the world’s biggest problems, such as climate change or mass migration, on its own. As he has largely done since leaving office, Obama did not mention Trump by name, but he made it clear that he disagreed with the president’s viewpoint. “You don’t have to cede your sovereignty or it doesn’t make you less patriotic to believe that,” Obama said. “You just have to have some sense - and read.”",1,fakenewsnet,,"In rare public speech, Obama decries Republican healthcare bill"

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Koch brothers, the most powerful conservative mega donors in the United States, will not use their $400 million political arsenal to try to block Republican front-runner Donald Trump’s path to the presidential nomination, a spokesman told Reuters on Wednesday. The decision by the billionaire industrialists is another setback to Republican establishment efforts to derail the New York real estate mogul’s bid for the White House, and follows speculation the Kochs would soon launch a “Trump Intervention.” “We have no plans to get involved in the primary,” said James Davis, spokesman for Freedom Partners, the Koch brothers’ political umbrella group. He would not elaborate on what the brothers’ strategy would be for the Nov. 8 election to succeed Democratic President Barack Obama. Three sources close to the Kochs said the brothers made the decision because they were concerned that spending millions of dollars attacking Trump would be money wasted, since they had not yet seen any attack on Trump stick. The Koch brothers are also smarting from the millions of dollars they pumped into the failed 2012 Republican presidential bids of Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney, the sources said. Donors and media reports have speculated since January, when the Kochs gathered 500 of America’s wealthiest political donors at a California resort, that they would deploy their vast political network to target Trump. The Kochs oppose his protectionist trade rhetoric and hardline views on immigration - which include building a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico and deporting millions of illegal immigrants. Many Republican figures and business backers are eager to see Trump, a political outsider who has tapped into rising anti-establishment sentiment, fail in his bid for the nomination. They prefer instead a more traditional candidate like U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. But with Trump racking up a series of wins in the early nominating contests against opponents including Rubio and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, there is a growing sense of inevitability that he will win the party’s mantle.

"Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton came out in agreement with Donald Trump last week on our role in NATO. They disagree on a solution but it s a great idea and about time they bring this to the forefront. SENATOR TOM COTTON ON AMERICA S ROLE IN NATO:Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton on Friday discussed his participation in a meeting with Donald Trump earlier this week, remarking that he and the Republican presidential frontrunner have similar concerns when it comes to the United States role in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. You know, he had spoken earlier that day to The Washington Post editorial board and raised some serious questions about NATO. I share some of those questions, Cotton said in an interview with MSNBC s Morning Joe. We used to split our costs 50/50 between the U.S. and Europe. Today, it s 70-30 between the U.S. and Europe. Read more: PoliticoIn an interview with The Washington Post editorial board, Donald Trump made an accurate statement about the U.S. subsidization of fellow NATO members:TRUMP: Look, I see NATO as a good thing to have I look at the Ukraine situation and I say, so Ukraine is a country that affects us far less than it affects other countries in NATO, and yet we are doing all of the lifting, they re not doing anything. And I say, why is it that Germany is not dealing with NATO on Ukraine? Why is it that other countries that are in the vicinity of the Ukraine not dealing with why are we always the one that s leading, potentially the third world war, okay, with Russia? Why are we always the ones that are doing it? And I think the concept of NATO is good, but I do think the United States has to have some help. We are not helped. I ll give you a better example than that. I mean, we pay billions hundreds of billions of dollars to supporting other countries that are in theory wealthier than we are.DIEHL: Hundreds of billions?TRUMP: Billions.Trump s GOP opponents jumped on his comments and accused him of suggesting that the U.S. should leave NATO, or at least cut back its support of the alliance.In fact, Trump was correct that the U.S. is paying hundreds of billions of dollars to supporting other countries via NATO each year, never mind additional military subsidies to non-NATO allies.In 2014, the collective GDP of all NATO members was US$37.5 trillion. During the same year, the alliance spent a total of US$924 billion on military expenditures, of which the U.S. spent the majority ($610 billion), according to the SIPRI Military Expenditure Database.Consequently, the alliance collectively spent 2.47% of GDP on defense. The U.S. was the only member above this value, coming in at 3.5% of GDP. In other words, the U.S. subsidizes each and every other member of NATO.This leads us to the following chart, showing the individual defense spending deficits toward the common defense in 2014 for each NATO member note that the U.S. has a surplus of US$180 billion that equals the sum of all other member deficits.Unsurprisingly, Germany (US$47 billion per year) and Canada (US$26 billion per year) are the biggest NATO laggards, followed closely by Spain and Italy at $US21 billion per year each. These four countries constitute almost two thirds of the total NATO deficit that has to be covered by the United States.Trump had good instincts on this.Read more: American Thinker",0,fakenewsnet,,DONALD TRUMP WAS RIGHT AGAIN: U.S. Funds NATO In The Hundreds Of Billions

See something SAY SOMETHING!WAIT WHAT? I THOUGHT OBAMA SAID ISIS IS JUST A JV TEAM!Federal authorities have warned local law enforcement officials across the country about a heightened concern involving possible terror attacks targeting the July 4th holiday, a U.S. law enforcement official said.While there was no specific or credible threat of attack, the official said the intelligence bulletin prepared by the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI alerted local colleagues to the ongoing threats posed by the Islamic State and other homegrown extremists. The official was not authorized to comment publicly.The bulletins are frequently issued in advance of major U.S. holidays out of an abundance of caution and concern that operatives may exploit the timing to generate greater attention.The warning comes as federal investigators have worked to disrupt a number of Islamic State-inspired plots, including a planned assault earlier this month on police officers in Boston. In that case, authorities fatally shot Usaamah Rahim as he allegedly planned to attack police with military-style knives.Also this month, a New York suspect in a Islamic State-related terror investigation was arrested after attacking an FBI agent with a kitchen knife during a search of his home.Fareed Mumuni, 21, was charged with attempted murder, after he emerged as a suspect in alleged plots to use pressure-cooker explosives and knives to attack police.In a statement Friday following attacks in Tunisia, France and Kuwait, DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson said local law enforcement was being encouraged to be vigilant and prepared in preparation for July 4th celebrations. We will also adjust security measures, seen and unseen, as necessary to protect the American people, Johnson said. We continue to encourage all Americans to attend public events and celebrate this country during this summer season, but always remain vigilant.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order on cyber security on Tuesday, two sources familiar with the situation said, marking the first action to address what he has called a top priority of his administration. The order is expected to commission several different reviews of the government’s offensive and defensive cyber capabilities, according to one of the sources and a third briefed on a draft of the order that circulated last week. The move follows a presidential campaign that was dominated by running storylines related to cyber security, including the hacking and subsequent leaking of Democratic emails as part of what U.S. intelligence agencies determined was a wide-ranging influence operation intended to help Trump win the White House and denigrate his challenger, Democrat Hillary Clinton. For months Trump refused to accept the conclusions of the agencies that Russia was responsible, before stating at a press conference on January 11 that, “as far as hacking I think it was Russia.” In his answer, Trump, then the president-elect, pivoted to say that “we also get hacked by other countries, and other people” while vowing to launch a government-wide review of vulnerabilities to cyber attacks. The order is expected to also initiate a audit of several federal agencies’ cyber capabilities, seek input on how to improve protections for critical infrastructure, and review government efforts to attract and train a technically sophisticated workforce, according to two of the sources briefed on the draft, which was first published by the Washington Post. The draft order would also seek ways to give the private sector incentives to adopt strong security measures.",1,fakenewsnet,,Trump expected to sign cyber security executive order Tuesday: source

"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon s army chief told his soldiers on Tuesday to be extra vigilant to prevent unrest during political turmoil after the prime minister quit, and accused Israel of aggressive intentions at the southern frontier. Troops should be ready to thwart any attempt to exploit the current circumstances for stirring strife, the army s Twitter account quoted General Joseph Aoun as saying ahead of Independence Day celebrations on Wednesday. The exceptional political situation that Lebanon is going through requires you to exercise the highest levels of awareness. Aoun called on troops to assume full readiness at the southern border to face the threats of the Israeli enemy, its violations, and the aggressive intentions it is indicating towards Lebanon. A senior Israeli official dismissed the warnings of border aggression as nonsense . Lebanon was thrust back onto the forefront of regional rivalry between Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shi ite Iran, after its prime minister quit this month in a broadcast from Riyadh. In his shock resignation, Saad al-Hariri railed against the Iran-backed Shi ite military and political movement Hezbollah, which both Saudi Arabia and Israel consider an enemy. The Lebanese president has refused to accept Hariri s resignation until he returns to Lebanon. The Saudis have demanded that Hezbollah stop meddling in regional conflicts and say it must disarm. Hezbollah has long said it must keep its arsenal to protect Lebanon from Israel, and its leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah accused the Saudis this month of inciting Israel to attack Lebanon. He said he could not rule out a new clash with Israel, although he described it as unlikely. In a televised speech on Monday, Nasrallah suggested the Saudis and Israelis were working together. Tensions grew earlier this year between Israel and Hezbollah, which fought a month-long war in 2006 that killed around 1,200 people in Lebanon, mostly civilians, and 160 Israelis, most of them troops. Israeli Energy Minister Yuval Steinmetz said this week that Israel has had covert contacts with Riyadh amid common concerns over Iran, a rare disclosure by a senior official from either country of long-rumored secret dealings. But Israel dismissed claims that it is planning military action against Hezbollah at the behest of Saudi Arabia. We are not interested in an escalation with Lebanon, Israeli Education Minister Naftali Bennett, a member of the security cabinet, told Reuters about the accusation of Israeli-Saudi collusion. However, Bennett added: If rockets are fired from Lebanon at Israeli cities, then we will see that as a declaration of war by the state of Lebanon and will act with all our might. In Israel, where the 2006 war was widely seen as inconclusive, there is little in the public mood or political discourse to suggest fighting with Hezbollah is imminent. But Israeli officials have voiced deep concern about Iran and Hezbollah s expanding influence in the region. The Saudis and Israel definitely have common interests today, including the threat from Iran, Israeli Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked said in a radio interview last week. The countries coming together could serve both of them. But, Shaked said, we don t work for anyone. We first and foremost look out for our interests.",1,fakenewsnet,,Lebanon army chief warns of Israel threat amid political crisis

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Neil Gorsuch, President Donald Trump’s U.S. Supreme Court nominee, on Monday emphasized the need for judicial independence even as Trump castigates jurists who have ruled against him, while Democrats questioned whether he would rule against abortion rights and gun control while favoring corporations. With the ideological balance of the Supreme Court at stake, the Senate Judiciary Committee opened its confirmation hearing for Gorsuch, a conservative federal appeals court judge from Colorado. Republicans praised Gorsuch, 49, as highly qualified for a lifetime appointment as a justice. “I think we’re off to a good start,” Republican Chuck Grassley, the committee’s chairman, said afterward, with senators getting their first shot at questioning Gorsuch on Tuesday. Committee Democrats noted Gorsuch has the chance to join the court only because Senate Republicans last year refused to consider Democratic former President Barack Obama’s nomination of federal appellate judge Merrick Garland. Despite slim chances of blocking his nomination in the Republican-led Senate, Democrats raised questions about Gorsuch’s suitability for the job. “Our job is to determine whether Judge Gorsuch is a reasonable, mainstream conservative or is he not,” said the panel’s top Democrat, Dianne Feinstein. Speaking publicly for the first time since Trump nominated him on Jan. 31, Gorsuch defended his judicial record in the face of Democratic criticism of his rulings. Gorsuch, speaking mostly in generalities that could not cause him any trouble, emphasized the need for “neutral and independent judges to apply the law,” warned against judicial overreach, and referred to “the modest station we judges are meant to occupy in a democracy.” “If judges were just secret legislators, declaring not what the law is but what they would like it to be, the very idea of a government by the people and for the people would be at risk,” Gorsuch said in comments in harmony with conservative criticism of unelected “activist judges.” Gorsuch, a cool-headed and amiable jurist, gave Democrats very little ammunition to use against him, although there could be more drama when he takes questions. The hearing could last four days, providing classic Washington political theater. Grassley said the panel is likely to vote on the nomination on April 3, with the full Senate vote likely soon after. If Gorsuch is confirmed by the Senate, as expected, he would restore a narrow 5-4 conservative court majority. The seat has been vacant for 13 months, since the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia in February 2016. Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal underscored the importance of judicial independence at a time when Trump has excoriated federal judges who have ruled against him on matters including two executive orders, put on hold by courts, to block people from several Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States. Blumenthal said it was not “idle speculation” to suggest the Supreme Court might be asked to enforce a subpoena against Trump, citing FBI Director James Comey’s testimony before Congress on Monday confirming an ongoing investigation into alleged collusion between Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia. Republican Ted Cruz said there is no reason for Gorsuch to be questioned about Trump, noting that previous nominees have not had to speak about allegations made against the president who nominated them. Democrats highlighted cases on which Gorsuch has ruled and questioned the influence of conservative interest groups in advising Trump on his selection. Feinstein emphasized abortion. Conservatives have long opposed the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling legalizing abortion nationwide. Feinstein called that ruling and others since then buttressing abortion rights “super precedents” deserving special deference. Feinstein cited two Gorsuch legal opinions in which she said he “argued in favor of making it harder to convict felons who possess guns.” Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy said he was worried that Gorsuch’s conservative method of interpreting the Constitution “goes beyond being a philosophy and becomes an agenda” that is anti-abortion, anti-environment and pro-business. “Will you allow the government to intrude on Americans’ personal privacy and freedoms? Will you elevate the rights of corporations over those of real people? Will you rubberstamp a president whose administration has asserted that executive power is not subject to judicial review?” Leahy said. Many Democrats contend Trump’s party “stole” a Supreme Court seat by freezing out Garland. “Your nomination is part of a Republican strategy to capture our judicial branch of government,” Senator Dick Durbin told Gorsuch. “That is why the Senate Republicans kept this Supreme Court seat vacant for more than a year and why they left 30 judicial nominees who had received bipartisan approval of this committee to die on the Senate calendar as President Obama left office.” Gorsuch said he has tried to treat all who come to court fairly and with respect. “I have decided cases for Native Americans seeking to protect tribal lands, for class actions like one that ensured compensation for victims of nuclear waste pollution by corporations in Colorado,” he said. He also said he has ruled for disabled students, prisoners and workers alleging civil rights violations, and for immigrants who entered the country illegally. The court’s ideological leaning could help determine the outcome of cases involving the death penalty, abortion, gun control, environmental regulations, transgender rights, voting rights, immigration, religious liberty, presidential powers and more. Republicans hold 52 of the Senate’s 100 seats. Under present rules, Gorsuch would need 60 votes to secure confirmation. If Gorsuch cannot muster 60, Republicans could change the rules to allow confirmation by a simple majority.",1,fakenewsnet,,Democrats raise doubts about Trump's high court nominee Gorsuch

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Democratic U.S. senator is backing away from a proposed legislative tweak that would have helped big banks lessen their capital burden, according to a statement provided to Reuters on Monday. Senator Christopher Van Hollen, of Maryland, had submitted an amendment to a financial regulatory reform bill that would give banks a partial reprieve from a rule known as the supplemental leverage ratio, according to the document Reuters reported on earlier on Monday. However, Van Hollen is against the changes and is not offering the amendment to the Senate Banking Committee as written, his spokeswoman Bridgett Frey told Reuters. She attributed the difference to an error in drafting the amendment, whose changes consisted of two paragraphs. “This is a drafting error,” said Frey. “To be clear, Senator Van Hollen opposes changing capital requirements for non-custodial banks, and he is fighting to ensure that the Federal Reserve writes a strong rule that governs the supplementary leverage ratio rules for custodial banks.” “To avoid any misinterpretation of his intent, he will not be offering the amendment as written,” she added. Wall Street bankers have complained about the supplemental leverage ratio for years, and changes to the rule are high on big lenders’ wish list as the financial reform bill works its way through Congress. The rule requires big banks that are subject to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s annual stress test to hold additional capital to reflect risks they pose to the broader system. Van Hollen’s abandoned amendment would have changed a part of the rule that requires lenders to hold capital against certain assets held at central banks. The change was one of more than 100 sought by banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co(JPM.N), Citigroup Inc (C.N) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), lobbyists said. The bill being drafted by the Senate Banking Committee was proposed by Republican Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo and is due to be formally discussed by lawmakers this week. Van Hollen is one of 11 lawmakers in the Democratic minority who sit on the committee. The stated intention of the bill is to reduce regulatory burdens on small- and mid-sized financial companies. However, that has not stopped large institutions from lobbying hard to secure regulatory relief they have been hoping for since Republican Donald Trump was elected president last year.",1,fakenewsnet,,Democrat cites drafting error in proposed capital rule amendment

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s proposals to slash federal aid to the poor, the sick and people living in rural areas reflect conservatives’ demands for a smaller federal government but target many of the very people who voted for him last November. In his first detailed budget submission to Congress on Tuesday, Trump requested major reductions to programs that help poor families afford groceries and poor and disabled people get healthcare. Job training for unemployed coal miners would be threatened and drug treatment programs would face cuts at a time when heroin and prescription pill addictions are tearing at rural America. Subsidies for commercial air travel in rural areas would be cut by more than half. The White House said many of the proposed cuts were aimed at ineffective programs and that the savings were needed to help balance the budget in 10 years and finance increased spending for defense and other programs. Some Republicans in Congress cheered Trump’s budget. Representative Mark Meadows, who heads the House of Representatives’ hard-right Freedom Caucus, called it “a great step forward” for conservatives, adding: “It’s all about economic growth.” But many other Republican lawmakers, seeing a budget they think will be tough to sell back home, greeted it warily. “These cuts that are being proposed are draconian. They’re not mere savings. They’re really deep, deep cuts,” said Republican Representative Hal Rogers, whose eastern Kentucky district relies heavily on federal aid. Trump trounced Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election in Kentucky, 63 percent to 33 percent, winning every region except the urban Louisville and Lexington areas. Rogers, a 36-year congressman, said the Republican president remained popular in his district, but added: “We have not yet had a chance to see how (voters) will react to his budget proposals.” It is unclear if the Republican-controlled House and Senate will be able to pass a budget blueprint for the fiscal year starting on Oct. 1. Democratic votes would also likely be needed to pass the fiscal 2018 spending bills needed to carry out budget priorities. But the proposed reductions could trigger a backlash for Republicans, complicating efforts to keep control of the U.S. Congress in the 2018 midterm elections. Trump’s own base of political support also could be undermined. Republican Representative Tom Cole, who represents an Oklahoma district that the Almanac of American Politics described as “countrified,” predicted “Congress would look at some of those things differently” from the Trump administration’s budget. Cole oversees spending on health and social welfare programs as chairman of a House Appropriations panel and has a medical research facility important to his district that relies on federal funding. “The National Institutes of Health is not likely to be cut. I think CDC (Centers for Disease Control) is not likely to be cut. I think that is ill-advised personally,” Cole told reporters. Atop Rogers’ list of worries is Trump’s proposed elimination of the $146 million Appalachian Regional Commission that has helped bring projects such as job training to unemployed coal miners, a broadband technology center to Kentucky and high-tech medical equipment to impoverished regions. The food stamp program, which helps low-income and disabled people buy groceries, would be reduced by $200 billion over 10 years. According to U.S. Department of Agriculture figures, bedrock Republican states that Trump won have long food-stamp rolls: 3.8 million people in Texas, 682,077 in Vice President Mike Pence’s home state of Indiana, 815,000 in Alabama and 1.6 million in Georgia, for example. Trump got broad support in last November’s election in counties with high numbers of white voters who receive food stamps. He was victorious in 991 of the 1,093 counties studied by the U.S. Census Bureau where the percentage of white households receiving food stamps exceeds the national average. Overall, according to a Reuters analysis, states would see federal aid shrink under the proposals by 3 percent in the next fiscal year, with cuts falling more heavily on states that voted for Clinton. States that voted for Trump would see federal aid decline by 1.2 percent, while those that supported Clinton would collectively see a drop of 4.8 percent. Liberal California would be hit hardest, with a 9.8 percent drop. Kentucky, a conservative state that signed on to the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion, would also be hit hard, with assistance dropping by 9.7 percent. Some Republican lawmakers welcomed the budget cuts. “I think we’re way over in the number of people who have been able to qualify for food stamps,” said John Carter, who represents a central Texas district. Trump’s proposed budget cuts would help pay for a 10 percent buildup in defense spending for next year, and help finance a wall on the southwest border that Trump previously had promised would be paid for by Mexico, something the Mexican government has adamantly said it will not do. The Medicaid healthcare plan for the poor is slated for about an $800 billion cut, reversing the expansion that former Democratic President Barack Obama’s signature Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, brought to Republican states like West Virginia, Arkansas and Kentucky with large populations of poor people. “Most of the (budget) cuts will focus on programs for low- income folks and public investments,” said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which pushes for long-term fixes to Washington’s debt problems. Levi Russell, spokesman for Americans for Prosperity, the conservative group backed by billionaire Charles Koch, applauded Trump’s call to balance the budget within 10 years, cut taxes and roll back regulations - moves he said would stimulate job growth. “It sends all of the right signals for the first time in nearly a decade - a budget that actually is focused on the best interests of the American taxpayer rather than what’s popular in Washington,” he said.",1,fakenewsnet,,Trump budget cuts may stir backlash in rural America

He announced his departure a day after Lourenco was sworn in as only the third president of Angola since independence from Portugal in 1975, ending 38 years of rule by Jose Eduardo dos Santos. Samakuva had previously said he planned to step aside, but had appeared to seesaw on the decision in recent months. During the campaign, I said I would leave the presidency of UNITA to serve the party in another function. I maintain and reaffirm that decision, Samakuva told a meeting of the party. Samakuva took over the leadership of UNITA - the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola - after the death of founder Jonas Savimbi who led the movement during 27 years of civil war. Savimbi s death brought peace and the transition of UNITA into a political party. Under Samakuva s leadership UNITA increased its proportion of the national vote from 10 percent in 2008 to 27 percent in 2017. Among those slated to succeed him are Adalberto da Costa, who was the party s leader in parliament under the previous administration, Rafael Massanga Savimbi, son of UNITA s founder, and Lukamba Paulo, a former secretary general of the party who lost a leadership election against Samakuva in 2003.",1,fakenewsnet,,Angola’s Samakuva to step down as UNITA opposition party leader

"BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives widened their lead over the Social Democrats following a television debate in which Merkel came across as more convincing and reliable than her SPD challenger Martin Schulz, a poll showed on Thursday. The weekly survey by Infratest dimap for ARD television showed support for Merkel s CDU/CSU bloc holding steady at 37 percent while the SPD dropped two percentage points to 21 percent - their lowest reading in the poll since early January. The pollster questioned 1,503 voters from Monday to Wednesday, meaning the survey was the first fully conducted after Sunday s television debate in which hardly any policy differences emerged between Merkel and Schulz. The anti-immigration, euro-hostile AfD came in unchanged at 11 percent, making it the third-strongest political force. The radical Left followed with 10 percent, up 1 point. The business-friendly FDP scored 9 percent, also up 1 point, while the environmental Greens were unchanged at 8 percent. The polls indicated two parties FDP and the AfD should enter the Bundestag as they look set to beat the 5-percent threshold. The fractured political landscape could make it hard to form a viable alliance other than the current grand coalition between Merkel s CDU/CSU and the SPD. Another scenario could be a tricky three-way Jamaica coalition between Merkel s conservatives, the FDP and the Greens, though such a broad alliance has never been tested on the federal level before.",1,fakenewsnet,,German SPD loses support after television debate: poll

"Patrick Henningsen 21st Century WireToday America will choose its next president. What can you say that hasn t already been said in this, the most over-analyzed political contest in history?No matter which side of this salacious Vaudeville ticket you are on, everyone will agree this has been the most raucous and divisive contest in electoral history. No matter who wins today, half the nation will be in pain, not least of all the Founding Fathers who have been rolling in their graves for the last 18 months.More than ever, America is a nation divided. An increasing number of people are now completely immersed in hyper-active social media environments, and so it s very easy to get caught up in one s respective partisan echo chambers; our way is the best way, our side is right, the other side is bad for America, we are the true party of the people etc. Many individuals simply will not venture off of their assigned party or pseudo-ideological reservations, much less talk to anyone whose views seem to oppose theirs. In public, partisan Americans will only huddle with those who share the same team colors, and in private each flees to his or her prefabricated partisan media outlet or social networking group. This virtual political matrix is now systematically divided in this way. There is nothing in between: no middle ground, no real commons, and no respite from the onslaught of partisan media. Herein lies the fundamental problem in 2016 politics and why the fall-out from this election will be ongoing long after the results are announced tomorrow morning.To make matters even worse, this election season has featured two highly flawed candidates in Donald J Trump and Hillary Clinton. Many commentators contend that these are the two worst US presidential candidates ever. Essentially it boils down to Mickey Mouse vs Cruella de Vil.Let s quickly profile the two candidates:Since the 1990 s the Clintons have been synonymous with one word: scandal. The 90 s was a dodgy decade for the First Family: Bill, Monica, Whitewater, the Arkancide epidemic, and selling White House s Lincoln Bedroom for 50 grand a night. Take your pick. None of this has helped Hillary in terms of public trust, where she s polling even lower than Donald Trump. On top of all the old Clinton baggage, you have two huge new scandals originating from her tenure as Obama s Secretary of State including becoming the latest member of her family to lie under oath to Congress (way to go Bill), this time over Hillary s private email server cover-up, and multiple pay-to-play corruption allegations at the Clinton Foundation.As result, Hillary Clinton embodies the avatar of Cruella de Vil Her campaign breaks down like this: Fighting for Woman and Children If you support Hillary Clinton then you believe your candidate represents the ascendency of the female species, and especially all women who have been held back by the cruel customs of an American patriarchal society. You also recognize her brand: Clinton. She s the wife of the 42nd President of the United States, Bill Clinton, which leads you directly into the second half of the campaign pitch: She has the experience, having been around the White House for 8 years. Since the beginning of her first campaign in 2008, Clinton the woman was the main identifier and the primary reason why she should be president. Instead it was the first black President, so she had to wait 8 years. At the age of 69, she s past her prime, but she d still be the first woman president and therefore, we re told, an inspiration to women everywhere as the marketing slogan says. She is also the champion of all minorities, as well as the poor which are also traditional Democratic Party staples, although the poor point is hard to square, seeing that the Clinton s have amassed a net worth in the hundreds of millions in the short space of 15 years primarily by monetizing their time in public office through enormous speaking fees and scraping off expenses and lifestyle extras from their billion dollar Foundation slush fund (a whole other scandal). Regardless, her supporters see her as their champion, rallying around a familiar set of leftwing social issues: inequality/redistribution of wealth, pro-choice/abortion, amnesty for undocumented/illegal immigrants, and man-made global warming/climate change.The novelty of Trump is like no other before him. At first, it could be explained like this: for some strange reason, it s a tradition in America that a certain number of people each year will cast a write-in vote for Mickey Mouse on their ballot. This is regarded as the ultimate protest vote a vote for Mickey is a vote against the establishment. So it should be no surprise that when he arrived on the electoral scene in June 2015, his support base was already waiting for him Trump was their 70 year old, 6 foot 3 inch, 236 lbs Mickey Mouse Trump s campaign breaks down like this: Make America Great Again If you support Trump, then you believe this is the story of a true underdog, the consummate outsider taking on the political elites a man with absolutely no experience in political office (other than writing cheques for nearly all them), uncorrupted by corporate money (because he has his own) and shunned by the self-serving political and media establishment who have done nothing for the country s working class and rapidly disappearing middle class. While some of this is true, as a reality TV icon, a billionaire property magnate and career playboy, Trump is certainly no man of the people in the Horatio Alger sense. Despite all that, judging by most major polls, nearly half of the United States population is behind him. To them, he is their champion. He ll lower taxes and bring back the jobs from overseas, rebuild the military, and most importantly, he doesn t want any money from corporate lobbyists. When crowds chant, Drain the swamp! referring to Washington DC, he s the man they want to hire to do that job. Trump s response to them is simple: I only work for one special interest group, and that s you the American people. In this sense, Trump has run the most unconventional political campaign ever.Love him or loath him, that message resonates and for good reason. The door to the cess pit is now open and many are horrified at what they see. Through the incredible WikiLeaks Podesta Email trove, many Americans have been able to peek inside the rude, incestuous and outright nasty elite political scene that controls Washington DC. Clinton was hit pretty hard by the WikiLeaks revelations, as was the already shaky credibility of the Clinton Foundation. This exposed a lot of the corruption around her and the party. Also, ten days before the election FBI Director James Comey through a grenade into the Clinton juggernaut by announcing the FBI would reopen Hillary s email case because of data discovered through her chief aid Huma Abedin s estranged sex-pest husband Anthony Weiner. This put a timely dent into Clinton s lead. With the help of the US media though, she battled though it and emerged from that m l e.Although he faced much less in terms of real institutional corruption scandals, Trump did not fair as well in public relations terms as Clinton did. Part of the reason for this was that Trump and the establishment media are like chalk and cheese. He s too unconventional for the bland gatekeepers. One of the reasons media operatives hated Trump was because he could generate his own gravity, and this posed a direct challenge to state-oriented propaganda machines like CNN who are busy spoon-feeding their own artificial version of reality to the American people. So, after a brief primary honeymoon, the media (aside from FOX News) declared all-out war on Trump. With each passing week, he was hamstrung by an endless string of media traps, Twitter gaffes and internal campaign tedium. Dogged by the media and his opponents, Trump couldn t hold his tongue or stay off of Twitter, and so his retaliatory tirades turned into negative headlines. For intelligent pundits and moderate supporters, the constant gaffes and distractions made it almost impossible to consider Donald Trump as a serious candidate. To the casual observer, it would appear that The Donald was nothing but a stalking horse for Hillary.The same could be said for Democratic primary challenger Bernie Sanders (photo, left). Up until the moment he entered the contest in July 2015, party favorite Hillary Clinton was essentially running unopposed. It s almost as if Sanders was drafted into the race at the last minute in order to make it look like a real race, and then at an opportune moment he would pledge his allegiance to the party favorite. That s exactly how it played out. Early on Sanders chances were practically DOA because of the Democratic Party s pre-rigged Super Delegate system. Still, he fought on and pulled bigger crowds than Hillary. Then the real bomb dropped when it was revealed through the Democratic National Committee (DNC) email leaks how party chairwoman Debbie Wasserman-Shultz along with party elites, conspired to railroad the Bernie Sanders campaign. That s right, Bernie was shot down by his own party in order to make way for Hillary s coronation. Not very democratic of the Democrats. Wasserman-Shultz even resigned as a result. Sanders didn t seem to mind (in public anyway) and voluntarily capitulated, and Hillary enjoyed a steady climb afterwards. From this we can deduce that the Clinton-Sanders contest was likely a contrived affair from the onset, although one WikiLeaks email shows that Sanders may even have been blackmailed into bowing down to Clinton. It seems that the DNC and Clinton never expected Sanders to capture the imagination of the nation s youth like he did, which also speaks volumes about the acute lack of enthusiasm for Clinton s White House run even within her own party. Sanders was a rock star, Clinton was a pop star. That s a big difference in the eyes of millennials who place a lot of value on authenticity.Then came the debates. The first one broke all ratings records for a political debate with an estimated near 100 million total viewers. It was Gladiator meets Jerry Springer. Then the New York Times leaked some of Trump s tax returns and the media had a field day. Later in October, a barrage of bombshells would besiege the Trump campaign, one after another, ranging from allegations of groping on a first class flight in the 1980 s, to a porn star upset over Trump s manly advances each of them suddenly appearing in the media right before the election to complain about being sexually harassed by Trump. After the first debate, a rather lurid, leaked off the record audio conversation from Access Hollywood in 2005 appeared which nearly upended his campaign, immediately followed by a new string of women coming forward with more allegations sexual abuse. This devastated Trump in the polls, and became the 24 hour obsession for Democratic Party-linked networks like CNN and MSNBC. Amazingly, every one of the accusers has since disappeared from the scene. The damage was done though, and this became the basis for the Clinton campaign, her TV ads and her surrogates anti-Trump message. Just like with Hillary s Podesta emails, it was non-stop media chaos. The attacks and counter attacks were many too many to mention here.Somehow, he crawled out of that pit and rebounded in the polls.Trump was also being attacked in the media for proffering that the system is rigged . In all seriousness, does anyone not believe this? Still, critics have called this extremist rhetoric from Trump. From a media standpoint however, America s democracy is rigged and clearly in favor of the Democratic Party. WikiLeaks proved through the release of Clinton Campaign Chair John Podesta s emails starting with the corruption between DNC acting chair Donna Brazile who cheated the debate process by passing questions from the network CNN directly to Hillary Clinton. If that wasn t bad enough, it was later revealed how the DNC tried to provide CNN anchor Wolf Blizter with questions to ask Donald Trump, and how DNC staffers offered CNN s Jake Tapper questions to ask during another interview on the network. CNN s chief political correspondent Gloria Borger was also exposed as one of many so-called journalists in private contact with the Clinton campaign. The online journal Politico s editor Glenn Thrush was also caught stage-managing coverage with the Clinton campaign. As yet, none of these media operatives have been fired, or have resigned which says a lot about the corrupt culture of the mainstream media in the United States today. There were many other incidents covered by WikiLeaks, too many to list here. Total collusion between the so-called press and the Democratic Party. So, yes, the system is rigged. This is no longer debatable, and the fact that the public now understand this should haunt media operative long after this election. When They Go Low, We Go High While this election may have been bad for the American people, it s been great for one groups of insiders: elite advertising agencies and the TV networks who sell ad space to the campaigns. The Clinton campaign combined with the pro-Clinton Super PACs spent upwards of $200 million on TV ads the majority of which were negative ads characterizing her competitor as a racist xenophobic womanizing misogynist. By doing so, the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party effectively made their pitch to voters as a referendum on political correctness. In other words, we can t allow this disgusting human being to win this election. The other big Clinton TV ad buy was, We can t let Donald Trump get his hands on the nuclear codes. This ad was based on the ridiculous premise that a US President could just walk into the Oval Office one day and start launching ICBM warheads around the world for no reason a completely bogus thesis if there ever was one, but apparently the campaign thought the public was stupid enough to believe this fictional scenario. As result of the all the negative campaigning, Clinton spent very little if any, substantial time speaking or debating the details of domestic issues and her chequered foreign policy record, particularly regarding the horrendous failures of Libya and Syria. Instead, on numerous occasions, especially during the debates, she would refer people to my website as if that s what people really wanted. Normally, people want to hear it from the candidates mouth, but the internet has offered a nice respite for politicians who prefer not to get tangled in discussing real issues in the flesh.It should be noted that from the beginning, the gender argument has been pervasive in all Clinton messaging, almost to the point of entitlement. It s about time for woman to become president. We re going to make history with the first woman in the White House. For many Americans, however, this message based purely on identity politics tends to push discussion of the candidate s credentials and policies to the background. It is also used to fend of any criticism or inquiry into policy specifics. Not surprisingly, Clinton has mostly steered away from specifics or making any promises unlike her predecessor Obama did when he promised everything imaginable for his first 100 Days in order to attract votes including closing the offshore eyesore, Guantanamo Bay Prison, and bringing the troops home from Iraq on his first day. None of this actually happened, which fuelled a lot of disenchantment and skepticism from younger voters this time around. Clinton s gender platform has also been augmented by a racial plank, and the campaign constantly reminds its supporters that blacks and other ethnic minorities should have common cause with women, inferring that their liberal cohorts have also been held back by the cruel customs of a white male-dominated, Anglo-Saxon patriarchal society. In 2016 Democrats have also reintroduced the topic of slavery as a major talking point, resulting in even more tension. Clinton s slogan is Stronger Together, but one could argue that it s possible the Democratic Party s obsession with promoting identity politics has done more to foster new political and social divisions (and subdivisions), rather than to unite all of society under a common national identity. This is a debate which should happen, but few dare to challenge the political left on that issue. Some food for thought: a recent Rasmussen Poll concluded that race relations in the US have deteriorated under President Obama, the highest dissatisfaction mark since he was elected eight years ago up 18 points since 2014. Why have race relations gone down hill? This poll result appeared for a reason, and it s probably not just because white America was upset they elected a black president in 2008, although this is what Democrats insist when you show them this particular poll. It could also be related to the caustic, relentless confrontational identity politics agenda being pushed by agents of change in the new radical left. Or maybe it simply reflects a fundamental failure of a political leadership which only panders to its own side of the aisle and shuns the other. America will remain divided unless both Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives can figure one how to overcome this flaw.Although Bill might be his wife s greatest asset, he is also her biggest Achilles heal. Hillary has built her entire political career on the back her two-term husband with the former First Lady slipping seamlessly into brand Clinton and a ready-made political legacy. After Hillary unleashed the misogynist card on Trump, Bill soon came under fire over his own sordid history of sexual deviance. After that, Bill was used sparingly in pubic. Instead, the Clinton camp relied heavily on the White House to do its campaigning for them. As a result, the First Lady, Michelle Obama and the President did many of the big campaign stops in Hillary s absence. Collectively, it seemed as if Hillary s VIP surrogates did more campaigning than she did herself. Multimillionaire celebrity surrogates lined up to stump for Hillary, including Katie Perry (image, above), Bruce Springsteen, Bon Jovi, Robert DeNiro, Jennifer Lopez, Madonna, Leonardo DiCaprio, Lady Gaga, Miley Cyrus, Jay Z, Beyonce and even LeBron James.Looking cool with the kids. So Clinton is being backed by the billionaire Hollywood entertainment wing of the Establishment.Even with all of that celebrity power though, Trump still attracted vastly bigger crowds on his own. But how? Why would a minimum of 15,000 at every stop turn out just for Trump?With more than a touch of irony, the one person who articulated this phenomenon better than anyone else was a radical left-wing icon, filmmaker Michael Moore. He recently filmed a one man show entitled TrumpLand where Moore s said this: I know a lot of people in Michigan that are planning to vote for Trump and they don t necessarily like him that much, and they don t necessarily agree with him. They re not racist or rednecks, they re actually pretty decent people, and so after talking to a number of them I wanted to write this:Donald Trump came to the Detroit Economic Club and stood there in front of Ford Motor executives and said, if you close these factories as you re planning to do in Detroit and build them in Mexico, I m going to put a 35% tariff on those cars when you send them back and nobody s going to buy them. It was an amazing thing to see. No politician, Republican or Democrat, had ever said anything like that to these executives, and it was music to the ears of people in Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin the Brexit states. You live here in Ohio, you know what I m talking about. Whether Trump means it or not, is kind of irrelevant because he s saying the things to people who are hurting, and that s why every beaten-down, nameless, forgotten working stiff who used to be part of what was called the middle class loves Trump. He is the human molotov cocktail that they ve been waiting for. The human hand grande that they can legally throw into the system that stole their lives from them.And on November 8, Election Day, although they lost their jobs, although they ve been foreclosed on by the bank, and next came the divorce and now the wife and kids are gone, the car s been repoed, they haven t had a real vacation in years, they re stuck with the shitty Obamacare Bronze Plan where you can t even get a fucking percocet. They ve essentially lost everything they had, except one thing the one thing that doesn t cost them a cent, and is guaranteed to them by the American constitution: the right to vote. They might be penniless, they might be homeless, they might be fucked over and fucked up it doesn t matter, because it s equalized on that day a millionaire has the same number of votes as the person without a job: one. And there s more of the former middle class than there are in the millionaire class.So on November 8, the dispossessed will walk into the voting booth, be handed a ballot, close the curtain, and take that lever or felt pen or touchscreen and put a big fucking X in the box by the name of the man who has threatened to upend and overturn the very system that has ruined their lives: Donald J. Trump. They see that the elite who ruined their lives hate Trump. Corporate America hates Trump. Wall Street hates Trump. The career politicians hate Trump. The media hates Trump, after they loved him and created him, and now hate. Yes, on November 8, you Joe Blow, Steve Blow, Bob Blow, Billy Blow, all the Blows get to go and blow up the whole goddamn system because it s your right. Trump s election is going to be the biggest fuck ever recorded in human history and it will feel good. Reading that, you can t help but feel that Moore has some real anger issues. Nonetheless, he inadvertently delivered the best pro-Trump speech of the election.For many, including Michael Moore, Trump might not be the ideal vehicle for such a profound movement, and yet, he is that vehicle.Granted, half of the American population have been conditioned to hate Trump for various reasons. But many of them are missing the key point in the Trump story, just like they did in the Sanders story. Trump offered millions of voters something profound: the idea that even in today s insulated political fortress that is Washington DC, anything is still possible in American politics where an outsider can come in and shake up a stale and corrupt ruling class.This concept should not be underestimated. It s a fundamental tenet of the American culture. As flawed an individual as he might be at this moment in time, Donald Trump is the avatar who embodies this idea of opportunity and hope.In today s political reality show and infotainment media environment, timing is everything and America loves a comeback. Trump s late October surge in the polls certainly reflected that public sentiment and overall enthusiasm. Trump has flown more miles and visited more cities than any other presidential candidate in memory so he s not leaving much on the table in terms of energy. Will this translate into votes in key swing states? We ll see Sure, when it all started, Donald Trump was Mickey Mouse, but somewhere along the way, the novelty has transformed into a bona fide movement. The fact that Trump, a candidate with zero political experience, bested a total of 16 other GOP primary candidates all of whom were seasoned, career politicians revealed just how profoundly unpopular establishment party stalwarts are with the general electorate. No amount of TV advertising can gloss over this realty. What began as a protest vote for so many who no longer trust or feel any affinity with elite politicians, has since morphed into a powerful mandate for change.Trump s victory during the GOP primaries was also historic it signalled an outright rejection of the party establishment, of the constant banal Republican bickering over who is the most conservative, and the traditional construct of the polished politician. Trump smashed all of this. He has done exactly as Reagan did in the 1980 s he pole vaulted over a stiff, entrenched establishment and took his message directly to the people.On the Democratic Party slate, the exact same phenomenon unfolded, with candidate Bernie Sanders gathering tens of millions of anti-establishment and anti-war voters in the 12 months preceding the Democratic Party Convention. In modern media terms Sanders couldn t be any less appealing with his unkept hair, the dandruff flaking off of the shoulders of his dodgy suit coats, and a semi-hunchback look. His supporters couldn t care less. The legions of college aged students didn t seem to care about the looks or the lack of Clintonesque cleverly scripted sound bites. Sanders could rattle off facts and issues without a teleprompter, and he did it with genuine conviction something Clinton still struggles with. Regarding the wars, as Sanders rightly pointed out, unlike Hillary Clinton, he voted against the Iraq War in 2003. This also resonated with the grassroots base. Additionally, unlike his opponent, Sanders was not pandering to Wall Street and accepting large sums of money from elite financial interests.To his base, Sanders was the real deal and for the same reasons that Trump s base is still behind him. The political and media establishment have gone to great lengths to conceal this reality, but in doing so they are only delaying their eventual demise.This is a long tail trend which is not going to reverse itself, and it s not confined to the US either it s international. We saw this to some extent with the BREXIT vote this past summer which defied the political media establishment s version of consensus reality. Political stalwarts and generational glad-handers will try their hardest to ignore it, but it s a clear public mandate away from the carefully controlled establishment model of politics. Last year in Britain, millions of voters shunned the Labour Party establishment and mainstream media favorites, and instead threw massive support behind the current Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Like Sanders, Corbyn is not a media poster boy. Before this year, you d have been hard-pressed to spot the aging Corbyn clean-shaven, or wearing a suit, much less a tie. This political shift confounded all of the experts and has triggered a tectonic shift in the Labour Party itself, as acolytes and devotees of former Prime Minister Tony Blair have all but thrown their toys out of their prams over the Corbyn issue. Like with Sanders, the people gathered in droves behind a brazenly anti-establishment and antiwar leader who was cast aside by the party establishment and media operatives.In Italy, a similar populist movement is well under way with the Five Star Movement, originally launched in 2011 by Italian comedian and entertainer Beppe Grillo. Five Star are now in Parliament. The term Five Star symbolizes five key issues for the party: public water, sustainable transport, sustainable development, right to internet access, and environmentalism. Similarly, Spain has recently seen the world s first crowd-funded political party with Podemos (translated We Can ). This is the future.As far as the lesser of two evils is concerned, the corruption issue weighs heavier with Clinton. While Trump s scandals derive from his private and business life, Clinton s scandals are from her time in public office, and involve current and past Democratic political operatives and appointees and so they deserve more scrutiny and accountability as they were done on taxpayer time, and bound by supposed strict codes of conduct. In stead, the media has worked hard to equate various mini-scandals from Trump with the mega-scandals of the Clintons when clearly these are two different things. Sp far, Clinton seems to have been able to remain above the law which has done a lot to fuel resentment against her, the White House and a highly politicized Department of Justice..On paper, America has a stark choice. Donald Trump seems to be an anti-globalist, anti-TPP, free market oriented, populist nationalist. Hillary Clinton seems to represent equality for all, but more than that she represents the status quo, a continuation of Barack Obama and his failing Obamacare legacy, an establishment elitist globalist agenda with a radical leftist bent.But how much will either candidate s presidency actually resemble their campaigns?If Clinton wins you can expect a huge celebrity-studded Gala Ball in Washington DC, followed by 18 months of Congressional hearings, indictments, impeach hearings and general gridlock. Expect the usual cast of suspects in her Cabinet, surrounded by all the usual insiders. Expect Bill to be named Hillary s Economic Tsar. In the Democratic tradition, Hillary will raise taxes and increase spending. This is why Wall Street loves Clinton (and why she accepts their money), because like with Obama, Clinton s Washington will certainly sink further into debt and Wall Street profits from this debt. Also, expect the Clintons net worth to sky rocket. Still, with so many scandals already on the boiler, it will get ugly, and it will stay ugly. There will be gridlock well into 2020. Like Obama did with the issue of race, Clinton will certainly make gender the defining issue of her presidency, as well as continue hammering home the idea that America has a race problem. The culture wars will continue and America will become a cultural Marxist battleground. Hillary Clinton s America will be a sectarian America. So expect those Rasmussen numbers to continue on their present trajectory. Expect Trump supporters to call foul on vote rigging too.There will be some vote rigging, as there has been in many US elections. Just this past week, there have been multiple cases of voter fraud in the US (and these are only the cases where people have actually been caught). . With Hillary, sooner than later, you can also expect an escalation of rhetoric and ill-informed talk of No Fly Zones in Syria and military a confrontation with Russia, and possibly even Iran. Lots of wars and proxy wars. This is why the Neocons love Hillary.If Trumps wins, the mainstream media will be in a state of shock, followed by a state of panic, followed by a state of chaos. Sure, Trump may wish to unite America, but this is a near insurmountable task now after 8 years of Sharpton-Obama political agitation and other artificial divisions constructed through hundreds of progressive front organizations funded by social engineers like billionaire George Soros. If Trump wins, expect the likes of Soros and MoveOn.org to unleash wave after wave of flash mobs, who will protest, riot, smash and burn their way on to CNN s 24 hour news rotation. Expect Occupy 2.0, and #BlackLivesMatter to rage. You can also be certain that Clinton, the Democrats and their media operatives at CNN, MSNBC and others, will blame Vladimir Putin and the Russians for hacking the US election in favor of Trump. Although Trump may cut taxes, like Reagan he will likely balloon federal spending. It is also unlikely Trump will make any significant dent in the national debt which is currently hovering around $10 trillion. However, with Trump, there is a chance to de-escalate the aggressive posturing this current White House and Hillary Clinton have take against Russia. This would be an important benefit of a Trump presidency a chance for a positive relationship between the US and Russia.Regardless of which person wins, expect FBI director Jim Comey to resign after this election.Expect both candidates to prosecute their war on ISIS , their war on poverty , their war on drugs and their war on domestic extremism. The election result is only the beginning. The real battle will take place afterwards.Expect a heavily divided and half bitter nation.Expect serious political party alternatives to emerge, building on the mild successes of the Libertarian and Green parties.Tomorrow, history will be made by either the outsider Trump, or the insider Clinton.When you re talking about the outsiders though, whether it s Trump, Sanders, Corbyn or Grillo, no matter how pious or forthright, they will ultimately get caught in the gears of government, with all its trappings of nepotism and institutional corruption. The outsider eventually becomes the insider. Resisting that pressure is the age-old challenge to any reformer.If there s one lesson to be learned by this year s US presidential race, it s certainly an old lesson by now. Depending on what your view of communism is, Karl Marx is either a villain or a hero of social engineering, but he left us some interesting quotes. Marx did get one thing right when he said, Elections give the people the right every few years to choose which member of the ruling class will misrepresent them. It s still true today.Or as someone once said, No matter who you vote for the government always gets in. We ll see which government gets in tomorrow.READ MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",0,fakenewsnet,,Trump vs Clinton 2016: Mickey Mouse vs Cruella de Vil

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie has dismissed him as a puppet and former mentor Jeb Bush called him not fit to serve as up-and-coming Republican Marco Rubio becomes the man to beat in next week’s New Hampshire primary. Rubio’s unexpectedly strong third-place showing in Monday’s Iowa caucuses has made him the target of rival Republican candidates who focused their campaigns on the New England state’s first-in-the-nation primary. Christie, the New Jersey governor, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and Ohio Governor John Kasich all hope for a strong showing in New Hampshire to boost their flagging campaigns to become the Republican nominee in the Nov. 8 election to replace Democratic President Barack Obama. While Christie said on Thursday he would not be out of the race if he lost to Rubio in New Hampshire, Kasich has told audiences he would go back to Ohio if he got “smoked” there. U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, who won the Iowa caucuses on strong evangelical Christian credentials, was expected to have less appeal for voters in New Hampshire. Real estate mogul Donald Trump’s second-place showing in Iowa raised questions about how well his popularity can survive the voting booth. Christie has been one of Rubio’s fiercest critics this week, calling the first-term U.S. senator from Florida “the boy in the bubble” the day after the Iowa vote. He continued the personal vein of attack on Thursday. “This isn’t the most controlled candidate we’ve seen in this race at all. His handlers handle him all the time,” Christie said on Fox News. “We need to take him out of that controlled atmosphere because, believe me, it won’t be controlled against Hillary Clinton this fall,” he said. Clinton, the former secretary of state, is battling U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont for the Democratic nomination. Bush, whose establishment Republican credentials have not guaranteed him public support, has also turned on his former protege. On Wednesday he took out a full-page ad in a leading New Hampshire newspaper, the Union-Leader, attacking Rubio as not ready to serve as commander in chief. “Nearly every political leader in Florida of stature who knows Marco and Jeb’s records have joined us in endorsing Governor Bush,” the ad read. Rubio has garnered significant endorsements since Monday, including U.S. Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, which holds its primary this month, and U.S. Representative Matt Salmon of Arizona, a co-founder of the conservative House Freedom Caucus.

"GENEVA (Reuters) - Myanmar authorities have agreed to allow the United Nations to resume distribution of food in northern Rakhine state which was suspended for two months, the World Food Programme (WFP) said on Friday. The agreement, whose details are still being worked out, came as UNICEF reported that Rohingya refugee children fleeing into Bangladesh were arriving close to death from malnutrition. The WFP was previously distributing food rations to 110,000 people in northern Rakhine state - to both Buddhist and the minority Muslim Rohingya communities. Rohingya insurgent attacks on police stations triggered an army crackdown, that the United Nations has called ethnic cleansing , and U.N. humanitarian agencies have not been able to access northern Rakhine to deliver aid since then. WFP deliveries have continued to 140,000 people in central Rakhine. WFP has been given the green light to resume food assistance operations in northern part of Rakhine. We are working with the government to coordinate the details, WFP spokeswoman Bettina Luescher told journalists in Geneva. She had no timeline or details on the proposed distribution of rations to northern Rakhine, and said it was still being discussed with the authorities in Myanmar. We just have to see what the situation on the ground is. It s very hard to say these things if you can t get in, Luescher said. Some 604,000 Rohingya refugees have fled to Bangladesh in the past two months, bringing the total to 817,000, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said. Malnutrition rates in Maungdaw and Buthidaung townships in Rakhine, where the vast majority of the Rohingya refugees originate, were already above emergency threshold rates before the crisis, the U.N. Children s Fund (UNICEF) said. Since August 25, we have had to stop treating 4,000 children with severe acute malnutrition in northern Rakhine because we have had no access, UNICEF spokeswoman Marixie Mercado told the briefing. UNICEF has screened nearly 60,000 Rohingya refugee children arriving in Bangladesh, nearly 2,000 of whom have been identified as having severe acute malnutrition, with another 7,000 moderately acutely malnourished, she said. The agency screened 340 children among recent arrivals, a rough and rapid exercise that found 10 percent to be severely acutely malnourished, she said. This is an extremely small number of children so these numbers are not representative, Mercado said. But what they do tell us is that some of the children are close to death by the time they make it across the border.",1,fakenewsnet,,"Myanmar gives green light to resume food aid to Rakhine, says U.N."
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - It would not be a bad idea for the European Central Bank and other central banks to follow the U.S. Federal Reserve’s example and change course away from an ultra-accommodative monetary policy, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said. Speaking on the sidelines of International Monetary Fund meetings in Washington, Schaeuble said the ultra-loose monetary policies in place in many areas of the world were not helpful. “It is encouraging undue risk-taking, political complacency, capital misallocation and asset price bubbles,” he added. “The Fed has initiated the exit from loose monetary policy. It wouldn’t be a bad idea, if the European Central bank and others were to start following this example,” he said. Three ECB policymakers said on Wednesday - days before a tense French presidential election and the ECB’s own policy meeting - that prospects for the euro zone economy had improved but the time to withdraw support has not yet come. Investors are on tenterhooks before Sunday’s first round vote in France, where two of the four leading candidates are threatening to leave the European Union and the euro currency. Any turmoil in the bond market after the French vote would push up borrowing costs for countries and companies - undoing some of the stimulus the ECB is providing - and even raise questions about the euro’s survival. While stressing that the ECB, and not the German government, sets monetary policy for the euro zone, Schaeuble added: “It is true that the euro being undervalued, from a German perspective, benefits our exporters.” German officials have said Schaeuble and his delegation will stress the importance of globalization and free trade for growth at the talks in Washington this week, as well as the need for reforms to increase resilience against future shocks.",1,fakenewsnet,,Germany's Schaeuble presses ECB to unwind loose monetary policy

"Donald Trump is not just Vladimir Putin s puppet anymore.When German Chancellor Angela Merkel visited the White House, Trump insulted her by refusing to shake her hand. Trump s behavior toward Merkel drew international outrage. Not only did Trump insult Merkel as a woman, he insulted our longtime ally. Germany is a fellow democratic nation that has supported the United States for decades.As we all know, Trump has lavished praise upon Vladimir Putin, complimented North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, and even invited Rodrigo Duterte, who has committed human rights atrocities in the Philippines, to the White House to pal around. You gotta give him credit, Trump once said in clear envy of Kim Jong Un. How many young guys he was like 26 or 25 when his father died take over these tough generals, and all of a sudden he goes in, he takes over, and he s the boss. It s incredible. He wiped out the uncle, he wiped out this one, that one. I mean this guy doesn t play games. But Trump went a step further on Monday when he not only met with Egyptian dictator Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, but also shook his hand twice while being serenaded as Your Excellency by el Sisi through a translator.Trump bragged about the United States military and how he is making it even bigger and more expensive, and suggested that Egypt is gong to benefit a lot from it.After singing each other s praises, Trump eagerly shook hands with the dictator without having to be asked and later shook hands again.Clearly, Trump values dictators more than our democratically elected allies.Here s the video via YouTube:Trump has been an admirer of el-Sisi for months and even met with him during the campaign months before Election Day.The Egyptian dictator does not respect human rights and often puts advocates for democracy in prison.This is the kind of leader Trump respects and wants to be friends with and that s a problem that should not be tolerated by the American people.Also, Trump is a complete hypocrite. While Germany pays for their own defense and military, Egypt currently gets $1.5 billion a year from the United States, and you don t see Trump handing el-Sisi a bill for it. Trump certainly isn t demanding that Egypt pay up like he did on Twitter two weeks ago when he falsely accused Germany of owing America money for their defense.Donald Trump s insulting behavior toward our democratic allies and his admiration of dictators is un-American.Featured image via screenshot",0,fakenewsnet,, WATCH: Trump Praises And Shakes Hands With Brutal Dictator After Previously Insulting An Ally

"21st Century Wire says It appears that Putin has had enough with being accused of tampering with the US election process this year. The Russian President s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, pointed out that it was indecent of the US to accuse Russia of tampering with its election. Remember: On Thursday evening CNN reported that Barack Obama vowed to retaliate against Russia for the hack that has not been verified by any independent sources nor has it provided a shred of evidence to support the claim Tyler Durden Zero HedgePutin has had enough of the relentless barrage of US accusations that he, personally, hacked the US presidential election. The Russian president s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said on Friday that the US must either stop accusing Russia of meddling in its elections or prove it. Peskov said it was indecent of the United States to groundlessly accuse Russia of intervention in its elections. You need to either stop talking about it, or finally show some kind of proof. Otherwise it just looks very indecent , Peskov told Reporters in Tokyo where Putin is meeting with Japan PM Abe, responding to the latest accusations that Russia was responsible for hacker attacks.Peskov also warned that Obama s threat to retaliate to the alleged Russian hack is against both American and international law , hinting at open-ended escalation should Obama take the podium today at 2:15pm to officially launch cyberwar against Russia.Previously, on Thursday, Peskov told the AP the report was laughable nonsense , while Russian foreign ministry spox Maria Zakharova accused Western media of being a shill and a mouthpiece of various power groups , and added that it s not the general public who s being manipulated, Zakharova said. the general public nowadays can distinguish the truth. It s the mass media that is manipulating themselves. Meanwhile, on Friday Sergei Lavrov, Russia s foreign minister told state television network, Russia 24, he was dumbstruck by the NBC report which alleges that Russian President Vladimir Putin was personally involved in an election hack.The report cited U.S. intelligence officials that now believe with a high level of confidence that Putin became personally involved in a secret campaign to influence the outcome of the U.S. presidential election. I think this is just silly, and the futility of the attempt to convince somebody of this is absolutely obvious, Lavrov added, according to the news outlet.As a reminder, last night Obama vowed retaliatory action against Russia for its meddling in the US presidential election last month. I think there is no doubt that when any foreign government tries to impact the integrity of our elections that we need to take action and we will at a time and place of our own choosing, Obama told National Public Radio.US intelligence agencies in October pinned blame on Russia for election-related hacking. At the time, the White House vowed a proportional response to the cyberactivity, though declined to preview what that response might entail. Meanwhile, both President-elect Donald Trump, the FBI,and the ODNI have dismissed the CIA s intelligence community s assessment, for the the same reason Putin finally lashed out at Obama: there is no proof.That, however, has never stopped the US from escalating a geopolitical conflict to the point of war, or beyond, so pay close attention to what Obama says this afternoon.According to an NBC report, a team of analysts at Eurasia Group said in a note on Friday that they believe the outgoing administration is likely to take action which could result in a significant barrier for Trump s team once he takes office in January. It is unlikely that U.S. intelligence reports will change Trump s intention to initiate a rapprochement with Moscow, but the congressional response following its own investigations could obstruct the new administration s effort, Eurasia Group analysts added.Continue the story at Zero HedgeREAD MORE MSM LIES AT: 21st Century Wire MSM Watch Files",0,fakenewsnet,,Putin Tells Obama and Western Media: “Either stop talking about it or finally show some kind of proof”

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday said “only one thing will work” in dealing with North Korea after previous administrations had talked to Pyongyang without results. “Presidents and their administrations have been talking to North Korea for 25 years, agreements made and massive amounts of money paid,” Trump said in a tweet. “...Hasn’t worked, agreements violated before the ink was dry, making fools of U.S. negotiators. Sorry, but only one thing will work!” Trump did not make clear to what he was referring, but his comments seemed to be a further suggestion that military action was on his mind. The president has previously said the United States would “totally destroy” North Korea if necessary to protect itself and its allies from Pyongyang’s nuclear threats. Earlier this week, during a meeting with top U.S. military leaders and their spouses, Trump told reporters it was the “calm before the storm.” Asked for clarification then on what he meant, Trump said: “You’ll find out.” Speaking to reporters on Saturday ahead of a trip to North Carolina, Trump said he had nothing more to clarify. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders referred to Iran and North Korea the following day when asked about Trump’s “calm before the storm” comments. Asked on Saturday about Trump’s tweet, Sanders said she had nothing to add to the president’s comments. The Pentagon referred a question for clarification to the White House and said the Defense Department’s job was to “present the president military options and carry out orders.” Trump repeatedly has made clear his distaste for dialogue with North Korea. On Sunday he dismissed the idea of talks as a waste of time, a day after Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Washington was maintaining open lines of communication with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s government. Trump said on Saturday that he had a good relationship with his secretary of state despite some disagreements. “We have a very good relationship. We disagree on a couple of things. Sometimes I’d like him to be a little bit tougher, but other than that we have a very good relationship,” he said. A Russian lawmaker on Friday was quoted saying North Korea was preparing to test a long-range missile that it believes can reach the west coast of the United States. Anton Morozov, a member of the Russian lower house of parliament’s international affairs committee, was part of a Russian delegation that visited Pyongyang from Oct. 2-6, according to Russian RIA news agency. North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missile programs have driven up tensions in the region and around the world in recent months, particularly after it conducted a test explosion of what it said was a hydrogen bomb.",1,fakenewsnet,,Trump says 'only one thing will work' with North Korea

"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said he was ready to step down in a couple of years time and his successor is likely already in the cabinet but a clear choice has yet to emerge In an interview with CNBC released on Friday, Lee, 65, the son of Singapore s founding father Lee Kuan Yew, said a new election could be called any time before 2021, when the current five-year parliamentary term ends. I am ready, said Lee, when asked if he was prepared to step down in the next couple of years. But he said he needed to make sure there was a successor ready to take over, adding: there are people in the wings. The question is, who it will be and that will need to be decided. I think it s very likely that he would be in the cabinet already but which one, well that would take a while to, to account, Lee said when asked he was close to finding a successor. Lee was speaking ahead of a visit to the United States starting Sunday - including a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House. Local media and analysts say Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat and Chan Chun Sing, a former army chief and a minister in the prime minister s office, are among potential successors. Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam could be a candidate, although he has repeatedly said he does not want the job and he would be a surprise choice because he is a member of the minority ethnic Indian community. Singapore s leader since independence has always been a member of the majority Chinese community. Questions about succession in the wealthy Southeast Asian city state - which has been governed by the People s Action Party since independence in 1965 - came into focus when Lee, who has twice survived cancer, took ill during a televised speech last year and stumbled at a podium. Doctors subsequently said there were no serious concerns. Lee Kuan Yew s successor, Goh Chok Tong, was identified at least five years in advance while the current leader, who first entered politics in 1984, was also groomed for the position long before he took office in 2004. [nL8N1B30B4] Prime Minister Lee said he was saddened by a feud with his siblings which played out in the public earlier this year over the fate of Lee Kuan Yew s family home. [nL3N1JV06P] The matter is in abeyance. I m not sure if it s solved, Lee said in the CNBC interview, adding he and his siblings had not recently communicated. Lee Hsien Yang and sister Lee Wei Ling accused their elder brother of abusing state power to try to save the house as a historic monument in defiance of his father s wishes. [nL4N1KR04A] The prime minister called for an extraordinary special sitting of parliament in July and subsequently said that debate failed to find any substantiated evidence of abuse of power. He has said the government must decide what to do with the property. Perhaps one day when emotions have subsided, some movement will be possible.

"Ever since Donald Trump got exposed through an audio tape leak for bragging about how he sexually assaults women, Trump supporters have been sticking up for their favorite misogynist more than ever.Following in the Republican nominee s footsteps, their only defense against the truth in those tapes is to put blame on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton s husband, former President Bill Clinton, for the rape allegations against him.Hillary is taking this all in stride, and is completely shutting down any Trump lovers who dare hijack her rallies and distract voters from focusing on moving America forward. During a rally with Al Gore in Florida today, Clinton s talk on climate change was interrupted by Trump supporters who were yelling about her husband being a rapist.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump vowed on Wednesday to step back from running his global business empire to avoid conflicts of interest but gave few immediate details as concern over his dual role mounts ahead of his Jan. 20 inauguration. Trump, a real estate magnate who owns hotels and golf resorts from Panama to Scotland, said he would spell out at a Dec. 15 news conference how he will separate himself “in total” from his worldwide business holdings, which include a winery, modeling agency and a range of other businesses. After Trump won the Nov. 8 election, his company, the Trump Organization, had said it was looking at new business structures with the goal of transferring control to Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump and Eric Trump - three of his adult children who are involved with the company. Trump gave few details in a series of early morning tweets but said that “legal documents are being crafted which take me completely out of business operations” and that his children would attend the news conference. He did not say what the planned change might mean for ownership of his businesses. Although Trump’s fellow Republicans generally take a more laissez faire stance toward business than Democrats, the president-elect will travel to Indiana on Thursday to formally announce a deal he reached with United Technologies Corp to keep close to 1,000 jobs at its Carrier Corp air conditioner plant in Indianapolis rather than have them moved to Mexico. Trump and his running mate, Mike Pence, the governor of Indiana, railed against Carrier on the campaign trail, using the company’s outsourcing move as an example of how trade agreements hurt American workers. Critics have raised questions about the role of Trump’s children, who are on the executive committee of his White House transition team. His daughter Ivanka joined a telephone call her father had with Argentine President Mauricio Macri earlier this month and attended a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, creating concerns about possible conflicts of interest. A brand name around the globe, Trump previously argued he had no need to separate himself from the Trump Organization, which includes a hotel down the street from the White House, a Manhattan tower where he lives and is running his transition to office, and a New Jersey golf course where he interviewed Cabinet candidates earlier this month. Trump said on Wednesday he was not required by law to alter his relationship with his business, but added: “I feel it is visually important, as president, to in no way have a conflict of interest with my various businesses.” As the Republican heads toward taking over the White House from Democratic President Barack Obama, scrutiny of potential conflicts has grown. Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill called for hearings on the issue. Rules on conflict of interest for executive branch employees do not apply to the president, but Trump will be bound by bribery laws, disclosure rules and the U.S. Constitution, which bars elected officials from taking gifts from foreign governments. The nonpartisan Office of Government Ethics, a government office that oversees ethics programs for the executive branch, issued a statement saying it applauded Trump’s aims and appearing to suggest that he completely shed his holdings. “Divestiture resolves conflicts of interest in a way that transferring control does not,” it said. Richard Painter, who served as the chief ethics lawyer to former Republican President George W. Bush, concurred. “He needs to sell the businesses not just have someone else manage them for him,” Painter, a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School, said in an emailed comment. Trump, a former reality TV star, has spent much of the past few weeks setting up his Cabinet and interviewing candidates for top jobs in his administration. On Wednesday, Trump said he would nominate his chief campaign fundraiser, Steven Mnuchin, to lead the U.S. Treasury. Mnuchin said the administration would make tax reform and trade pact overhauls top priorities as it seeks a sustained pace of 3 percent to 4 percent economic growth. Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker, also signaled a desire to remove U.S. mortgage-finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from government ownership, a move that could have wide-ranging ramifications for how Americans pay for their homes, and said banking regulations should be eased to spur lending. Trump named Wilbur Ross, a billionaire known for his investments in distressed industries, as his nominee for commerce secretary. Both nominees will require confirmation by the U.S. Senate. Trump is also considering Goldman Sachs President and Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn, a former commodities trader, to head his White House budget office or to fill another position, a Trump transition official said. The economic picks were praised by the Business Roundtable, a group that represents America’s largest corporations. But U.S. Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren called Mnuchin “just another Wall Street insider.” “That is not the type of change that Donald Trump promised to bring to Washington - that is hypocrisy at its worst,” Sanders, a Vermont independent who ran for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, and Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, said in a joint statement. Trump pledged during his campaign to “drain the swamp” in Washington. A spokesman said giving top economic jobs to Wall Street figures was not inconsistent with that vow. “You want some people that are insiders and understand the system and some outsiders that are creative thinkers, out-of-the-box thinkers and disruptors,” said Anthony Scaramucci, an asset manager who is on Trump’s transition committee. Trump is also working to fill out his foreign policy team, but no decision appeared imminent on who the next secretary of state would be.",1,fakenewsnet,,Trump says he will back away from business to focus on White House

"LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May promised on Sunday to challenge any “unacceptable” talk when she meets President Donald Trump later this week, as she tries to secure Britain’s “special relationship” with the new U.S. administration. May, Britain’s second female premier, made the comments after thousands of women marched in London on Saturday to protest about Trump’s attitude to women, joining demonstrations held in major cities across the globe. She told the BBC she would use Friday’s meeting in Washington to discuss issues including future U.S.-UK trading relations, following Trump’s promise to put “America first” in his inauguration speech on Friday. Since Britons voted last year to leave the European Union, May’s government has been keen to deepen ties with the United States and other nations outside Europe to show that Brexit will not diminish its standing in the world. May indicated she would not shy away from any difficult issues, when asked about the controversy over Trump’s comments on women. This erupted last year during the presidential election campaign over a 2005 video in which he boasted about grabbing women’s genitals. “I’ve already said that some of the comments that Donald Trump has made in relation to women are unacceptable, some of those he himself has apologized for,” May said. “When I sit down (with Trump) I think the biggest statement that will be made about the role of women is the fact that I will be there as a female prime minister,” she said. “Whenever there is something that I find unacceptable I won’t be afraid to say that to Donald Trump.” Trump’s election has raised questions over the future of the so-called “special relationship” that has underpinned close British-American ties for decades, but the new U.S. leader has said he believes Brexit will be “a great thing”. May, who initially struggled to build relations with Trump’s team, said she would also use the meeting to discuss the NATO defense alliance and challenges such as defeating terrorism and the conflict in Syria. Becoming one of the first world leaders to meet with Trump following his inauguration will be viewed as a coup for May, who was perceived to have been snubbed by the billionaire following his election when he spoke first to nine other world leaders. She will be trying to improve relations with Trump after he irritated the British government by meeting Nigel Farage, an outspoken anti-EU campaigner and critic of May, and saying he would be a good choice for Britain’s ambassador to Washington. Opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn cast doubt on whether Trump, who has promised to protect American jobs and industry from foreign imports, would offer Britain much. “There were no signs of any special relationship in Donald Trump’s inauguration speech. Quite the opposite, it was ‘America first, America only’,” he told Sky News. “The idea that Donald Trump is suddenly going to roll over and offer some trade deal with Britain which doesn’t have strings attached ... I think she needs to be extremely careful.” British newspapers were divided on the visit, with the Sunday Telegraph reporting Trump calls May “My Maggie”, referring to her predecessor Margaret Thatcher, who enjoyed a close relationship with her U.S. counterpart Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. The front page of the Mail on Sunday however, ran the headline: “Cut out your sexist insults, Mr President”. Brexit supporters have cheered comments by Trump that he wants to arrange a swift bilateral trade deal with Britain, but others have cautioned his protectionist policies make an agreement which is good for Britain unlikely. The Telegraph also reported plans were underway for a state visit to Britain later this year by Trump, who has played up his ancestral ties to Britain, saying in an interview this month that his Scottish mother was “so proud” of Queen Elizabeth.",1,fakenewsnet,,UK PM May promises frank talk with Trump after women protest

"WIKILEAKS JUST DROPPED DOCUMENTS EXPOSING THE CIA SPYING AND HACKING:The CIA hacks iPhones, Android phones and TVs Via Wikileaks:Today, Tuesday 7 March 2017, WikiLeaks begins its new series of leaks on the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. Code-named Vault 7 by WikiLeaks, it is the largest ever publication of confidential documents on the agency.The first full part of the series, Year Zero , comprises 8,761 documents and files from an isolated, high-security network situated inside the CIA s Center for Cyber Intelligence in Langley, Virgina. It follows an introductory disclosure last month of CIA targeting French political parties and candidates in the lead up to the 2012 presidential election.Recently, the CIA lost control of the majority of its hacking arsenal including malware, viruses, trojans, weaponized zero day exploits, malware remote control systems and associated documentation. This extraordinary collection, which amounts to more than several hundred million lines of code, gives its possessor the entire hacking capacity of the CIA. The archive appears to have been circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive. Year Zero introduces the scope and direction of the CIA s global covert hacking program, its malware arsenal and dozens of zero day weaponized exploits against a wide range of U.S. and European company products, include Apple s iPhone, Google s Android and Microsoft s Windows and even Samsung TVs, which are turned into covert microphones.Since 2001 the CIA has gained political and budgetary preeminence over the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). The CIA found itself building not just its now infamous drone fleet, but a very different type of covert, globe-spanning force its own substantial fleet of hackers. The agency s hacking division freed it from having to disclose its often controversial operations to the NSA (its primary bureaucratic rival) in order to draw on the NSA s hacking capacities.By the end of 2016, the CIA s hacking division, which formally falls under the agency s Center for Cyber Intelligence (CCI), had over 5000 registered users and had produced more than a thousand hacking systems, trojans, viruses, and other weaponized malware. Such is the scale of the CIA s undertaking that by 2016, its hackers had utilized more code than that used to run Facebook. The CIA had created, in effect, its own NSA with even less accountability and without publicly answering the question as to whether such a massive budgetary spend on duplicating the capacities of a rival agency could be justified.In a statement to WikiLeaks the source details policy questions that they say urgently need to be debated in public, including whether the CIA s hacking capabilities exceed its mandated powers and the problem of public oversight of the agency. The source wishes to initiate a public debate about the security, creation, use, proliferation and democratic control of cyberweapons.CHINA IS ALSO GETTING IN ON THE ACT:",0,fakenewsnet,,"MASSIVE WIKILEAKS DROP Exposes CIA Spying via iPhones, Android Phones and Samsung TVs [Video]"

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats in the U.S. Congress wield little clout nowadays, but they will likely have plenty of influence on the looming issue of the U.S. debt ceiling and party leaders are considering whether they should try to convert that advantage into bargaining power on tax reform. Even though they control the White House and both chambers of Congress, Republicans are again divided among themselves as pressing fiscal issues rattle financial markets and test President Donald Trump’s ability to keep the country’s accounts in order. The debt ceiling is a legal cap on how much money the federal government can borrow to fund its budget deficits and meet debt obligations. Failure to meet payments could lead to a default and a downgrade in America’s credit rating, with the potential to trigger global financial shockwaves. Speaking to reporters at the White House on Friday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he was “100 percent confident” that the debt ceiling would be raised in September. “There is no scenario where the government won’t be paying its bills,” Mnuchin said. Action is needed to raise the debt ceiling by Sept. 29, the administration has warned, although some fiscal experts say the deadline may actually be mid-October. The Trump administration wants Congress to pass a “clean” increase, without extraneous political measures attached. But, reflecting long divisions in the party over fiscal policy, many conservative Republicans have said they will not vote for a debt-limit bill that does not also contain promises of federal spending cuts. So, analysts say, Trump and Republican leaders will need the votes of Democrats, who generally favor a clean bill, to raise the debt limit and avoid a default. Armed with this edge, Democrats are considering using the debt debate to press Republicans for bipartisan tax reform, said Democratic Senate aides, which would inject new uncertainty into the debt limit issue. Overhauling the tax code is a top priority for Trump and his fellow Republicans, but they have made little progress since the president took office in January. Their behind-closed-doors planning process so far on tax reform has ignored the Democrats. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi are skeptical about supporting a debt ceiling increase while Republicans pursue tax cuts that Democrats say would cause the federal deficit to balloon. “We’re telling Republicans that if it is their intention to use that debt limit increase to allow for tax cuts for the wealthy, that they are going to have a harder time getting Democratic votes,” said a Senate Democratic aide. Senate Democrats offered earlier this month to move forward with bipartisan legislation on taxes, on condition that changes do not add to the deficit or benefit the wealthy. For now, Senate and House Democrats are watching Republicans and the Trump administration wrangle over the debt ceiling, with no clear plan yet in sight. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan have not said if they want a clean bill. Ryan said on Thursday that Congress will pass legislation to raise the federal debt ceiling, noting that lawmakers have several options. McConnell has said the debt ceiling will be raised, a spokesman said on Thursday. Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill said in an email: “Leader Pelosi has expressed support for a clean debt ceiling hike, but has also echoed the concerns that many House Democrats have about supporting such a move while Republicans simultaneously blow a multi-trillion dollar hole in the deficit with tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires.” Given the stakes, Schumer and Pelosi would face a daunting task in holding their parties’ lawmakers together if they want to squeeze concessions out of Republicans with the country on the brink of a potential default. Some Democrats are skeptical such a strategy could work. “We ought to get the debt ceiling done. It’s a bad precedent to try to use the debt ceiling for leverage for other political objectives,” said Representative John Yarmuth, the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee. Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell expressed concern on Friday about the possibility of the debt ceiling not being raised. “If the debt ceiling were not to be raised, the United States would not be able to pay all of its bills. That’s never happened before; it would be unprecedented and that could be a major shock to the economy,” Powell said in an interview with CNBC during a conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Democrats have been talking about using the debt ceiling as a lever against Republican tax reform since June and laid out their conditions for working together on tax legislation in an Aug. 1 letter to Trump and Republican leaders. McConnell flatly rejected the idea of broad bipartisanship. But it could be the only way forward on taxes if Republicans cannot agree on a budget resolution for fiscal 2018. That is needed to unlock a legislative provision that would allow them to pass a tax bill in the Senate, where Republicans have only a slim majority, without Democratic support.",1,fakenewsnet,,"Holding keys to debt limit, Democrats weigh tax demands"

"(Reuters) - President Donald Trump acted well within his authority in issuing his executive order on immigration, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton told a federal appeals court on Wednesday. Paxton, a Republican, attached a brief in asking the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in California for permission to argue in support of Trump’s temporary ban on travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Texas is the first state to back Trump in the closely watched litigation. A group of 15 states and the District of Columbia have filed papers with the appeals court in support of Washington state’s challenge to Trump’s Jan. 27 order, saying it harms their educational institutions and economies. Paxton said the full court should reconsider whether a lower court judge was justified in halting the ban. U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle suspended Trump’s order across the country on Feb. 3. Washington state argued that it violated constitutional protections against religious discrimination. That ruling was upheld by a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit in San Francisco last week, raising questions about Trump’s next step. The appeals court will soon vote on whether to reconsider the case with an 11-judge panel. Trump’s directive, which he said was necessary to protect the United States from attacks by Islamist militants, barred people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the country for 90 days. Refugees were banned for 120 days, except those from Syria, who were banned indefinitely. The rulings put the order on hold until the courts can rule on the underlying merits. Ultimately, they will have to address questions about the extent of the president’s power on matters of immigration and national security. Traditionally, judges have been extremely cautious about stepping on the executive branch’s authority in such matters, legal experts said. In the brief, Paxton said the order had a clear national security goal, to ensure proper vetting of foreigners seeking entry into the United States. It “reflects national-security interests implicated by the ongoing War on Terror against radical Islamic terrorists.” Paxton rejected any claim that the order discriminates against Muslims while favoring Christian minorities. If that argument is accepted, he said, it would jeopardize the government’s ability to help persecuted religious minorities abroad by granting them refugee status. Texas led the legal fight against President Barack Obama’s plan to protect up to four million immigrants from deportation, joined by 25 other Republican-led states. The challengers won a February 2015 nationwide injunction blocking the program before it was due to go into effect. In June 2016, the Supreme Court split 4-4 in the case, leaving in place an appeals court ruling in favor of the states.. A major question in that litigation was whether Texas had legal standing to sue, an issue that the Supreme Court did not resolve. In Wednesday’s brief, Texas did not address whether Washington and other states had standing to sue over Trump’s ban.",1,fakenewsnet,,Texas attorney general backs Trump in travel ban litigation

"(Reuters) - At least 313,000 Rohingya refugees have fled Myanmar in the past two weeks and sought shelter in Bangladesh, a Inter Sector Coordination Group (ISCG) report released on Monday stated. At least 400,000 hungry and traumatized refugees have sought refuge in Bangladesh since October 2016. The exodus has put pressure on aid agencies and communities, which were already helping hundreds of thousands of refugees from previous violent episodes in Myanmar.

"HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama sought on Wednesday to ease growing Asian worries about the raucous election campaign to succeed him which has been dominated by the incendiary rhetoric of mogul Donald Trump, now the Republican Party’s nominee. “I think other people sometimes look at our election system and say ‘what a mess’,” Obama told a townhall meeting with young leaders in Vietnam’s Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon. “But usually we end up doing okay because the American people are good people ... Sometimes our politics doesn’t express all the goodness of the people,” he said, without referring specifically to any of the presidential candidates. Obama made the comments just before ending a three-day trip to Vietnam, whose high point was an announcement that Washington’s ban on sales of lethal weapons to the country - a vestige of the Vietnam War - would be completely lifted. Obama repeatedly insisted that lifting the embargo was not a response to Beijing’s assertiveness in the South China Sea. Critics accused Washington of throwing away a powerful lever it had to press communist-ruled Vietnam for improvements in human rights. White House officials say the arms move was a natural step to take with a country that, once an enemy, is now a key part of Obama’s strategic ‘rebalance’ towards Asia and an important trade partner as its economy grows apace. Obama also announced the Peace Corps would begin operating in Vietnam for the first time. Across Asia, policymakers have been startled by Trump’s “isolationist” foreign policy pronouncements, which have challenged much of the status quo in Washington’s relations with the region. Many fear Trump will feed insecurity in nations worried about China’s growing power, embolden nationalists and authoritarians, and unravel Obama’s ‘pivot’ to the Asia-Pacific. At the townhall in Ho Chi Minh City, a young woman who had been an exchange student in Montana asked Obama what he thought of the prospects that Trump or Democratic contenders Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders following him to the White House. “Usually, eventually the voters make good decisions and democracy works,” replied Obama, whose criticism of Trump has sharpened since he all but clinched the Republican nomination. “Things are going to be ok. I promise.” Thousands of people lined the streets of Ho Chi Minh City for a second day to cheer enthusiastically and wave mini-flags of Vietnam and the United States as Obama drove by on his way to the airport for a flight to Japan. At his freewheeling townhall, where he was greeted with a standing ovation, Obama noted that two-thirds of the country’s population were born after 1975, when the war ended with North Vietnamese tanks rolling into Saigon to bring U.S.-backed South Vietnam under communist rule. Obama prodded Vietnam’s leaders on political freedoms during his visit after critics of the government were prevented from meeting him. When a woman rapper at the townhall asked him about supporting arts and culture, he segued into an appeal for people to be allowed to express themselves. However, his unusually long one-country visit was warm and mostly about strengthening diplomatic and economic relations. Annual U.S.-Vietnam trade has swelled from $450 million when ties were normalized in 1995 to $45 billion last year. Washington is a big buyer of Vietnam’s televisions, smartphones, clothing and seafood. Obama repeatedly touted the benefits of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact, of which export-led Vietnam will be one of the biggest beneficiaries, if it survives opponents in Washington concerned about competition and a loss of U.S. jobs. He also talked about the challenges of climate change when asked about the drying-up of the Mekong River in the rice-bowl delta of southern Vietnam, urging Southeast Asian countries to work together. The Mekong River, which sustains 60 million livelihoods as it flows through Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam, is under threat from at least 39 hydro-electric dams being built or under development upstream of Vietnam, most of them in China. Low river levels have allowed seawater to penetrate inland, ruining vast swathes of cropland in the fertile delta. Obama did not name any of the upstream countries but said the United States would provide smaller member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) with technical assistance and evaluations of what needs to be done. “Hopefully ... that information can be used to negotiate on an international level to try to prevent some projects that might have very bad effects,” he said. “One of the things that we’ve seen in ASEAN is that when small countries band together as a unit, then the power magnifies.” Japan is the final stop on Obama’s swing through Asia, where he is attending a summit of the Group of Seven industrialized nations starting Thursday.",1,fakenewsnet,,Obama to Asians worried about U.S. election: It's going to be OK
"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian President Michel Temer’s government introduced to Congress on Tuesday a landmark constitutional amendment to cap public spending, seeking to press ahead with unpopular reforms in the wake of last weekend’s municipal elections. Temer’s new center-right government hopes the proposal, which would limit growth in spending to the rate of inflation for up to 20 years, will clear a Congressional committee this week and be put to a vote in the lower house by next week. The amendment is designed to curb a budget deficit equivalent to 10 percent of gross domestic product last year. Hopes for its passage have made Brazilian assets among the best performing in the world this year despite an economy submerged in a two-year recession. In a concession to ease its passage, the government announced on Monday that a cap on health and education expenditure would not go into effect until 2018, rather than next year. Leftist opponents have demanded more time to debate a measure they say violates the spirit of Brazil’s 1988 constitution, which made generous provisions for social spending. They plan to seek a court injunction to block the amendment. Backers warn that Latin America’s largest nation, which is wrestling with a sprawling corruption scandal, could follow Greece’s path to financial meltdown if spending is not controlled. Temer said on Monday that public debt, which ended last year at a level equivalent to two-thirds of economic output, would reach 100 percent of GDP by 2024 without the measure. “If this change is not adopted, fiscal collapse and the insolvency of public accounts are inevitable,” lawmaker Darcisio Perondi said in his report to the committee studying the measure. “Brazil could repeat the tragedy of Greece.” Perondi said the previous government of Dilma Rousseff, who was removed from office in August for breaking budget laws, left an onerous legacy of overdrawn accounts, and he called on the lawmakers who impeached her to back the cap. The conclusion of municipal elections in most cities across Brazil last weekend allows Temer’s ruling Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB) and its coalition allies a freer hand to back the measure. A small number of cities face a second-round runoff this month. But resistance from Rousseff’s Workers Party and its allies, as well as division within Temer’s own coalition, point to a difficult path for a proposal that requires two approvals in each chamber of Congress by a three-fifths majority. “We will seek an injunction because this violates the Constitution and the right of five future governments to decide their economic policies,” said opposition leader Jandira Feghali of the Communist Party of Brazil. Temer, 75, who was sworn in to serve the remainder of Rousseff’s term through 2018, had vowed to put Brazil back on its tracks and investors like his promises of fiscal discipline. But a poll published on Tuesday showed Temer has failed to convince Brazilians that his government is any better than Rousseff’s. The survey by pollster Ibope showed that Temer’s approval ratings remain low and some 68 percent of Brazilians do not trust him. The lower House is also expected to vote on Tuesday on a bill that changes the rules for the exploration of Brazil’s vast offshore oil reserves in the costly subsalt layer, aimed at boosting private investment in the oil industry. The proposal removes the obligation for scandal-plagued, debt-ridden state oil company Petrobras to be the only operator of these oil fields and have a minimum 30 percent stake in their development.",1,fakenewsnet,,"Elections over, Brazil tackles unpopular spending reforms"

empire as a young man he took a presidents shilling and served in the us army in his free time he enjoys studying history and destroying the sjw revisionist narrative november politics there have been few true upsets in our history caesar crossing the rubicon wellingtons victories at assaye and waterloo and washingtons victory at yorktown over the most professional army in the world it is often said that when general charles ohara who had the dubious distinction of surrendering to both george washington and napoleon bonaparte surrendered cornwalliss sword the band played the world turned upside down today the establishment and the intellectuals cannot help but share a similar sentiment as cornwallis or ohara did at yorktown and i fully admit in spite of my vote for trump i fully expected him to lose the polls his negative approval rating and the sheer forces of the media the fbi and even some republicans were arrayed against him my skepticism of trump was not his ideas but his chances of winning the election myself and other conservative intellectual skeptics who voted for him were wrong i am one of the intellectuals who expected a trump defeat ive been studying politics history and economics for years reading countless books on the matter from the prince to freakonomics to the wealth of nations and i was wrong it was a canadian housewife and an iranian pickup artist who called it correctly for trump trump beat the odds he beat the intellectuals and made the establishment babies in the hands of a giant as was said after napoleons resounding victory at austerlitz in the left is currently in panicmode in an attempt to explain how they lost they are calling trump supporters racist sexists homophobic and even sex offenders but in the end it was this same blindness that made them psychologically incapable of defeating donald trump trump was immune to almost all conventional political weapons trump won because of the following the left seemed far more interested in calling trump and his supporters racist than saying something of substance outlets such as the new york times did blatantly stupid crap like try to blame the nra for the orlando shootings and even tried to call them terrorists in this they beat even trump in outrageousness they thought the american people were stupid so they just lied to them and said fuck it those peasants will believe anything we write all trump had to do was call them on their bullshit and call them liars and he was right the msm has lied to the american people this entire election cycle subsequent to every terrorist attack perpetrated by a muslim the msm continued to push the narrative that home grown rightwing terrorism is the real problem trump called them on their lies and the american people who are tired of being lied to by the msm cheered him on even if he had a few issues with the truth himself the democrats ran the absolute worst candidate possible hillary clinton had negative approval ratings that rivaled trumps own and she was bland and she couldnt decide if she was a moderate or a firebrand progressive and she is corrupt and lied about it stupidly thinking the american people were too ignorant to understand that putting classified information on a private email server is a recklessly irresponsible thing to do trump knew how to communicate with people he knew that whites without a college degree were tired of being talked down to by progressives on the left and genuine intellectuals on the right like myself i freely admit i am guilty of this when you study two thousand years of philosophy economics and rhetoric cicero was particularly effective it is sometimes frustrating when people dont approach a situation in terms of axioms and proofs the working class that built america go by what they feel in their gut and often times they are right all in all the left failed because they failed to understand america they bought into the idea that americans are stupidhaha americans are not stupid they may not be smart but they sure as hell know when a liberal taking head is lying to them about now the nra is basically the taliban in an obviously biased hit piece hillary took working class americans for granted and she lost this should stand as a parallel for black americans whom the democrats also take for granted i am pleased that donald trump is now presidentelect he wasnt just a candidate he was the anticandidate he did everything a politician should not do he used vulgar language he talked freely about his ideas he made no pretense about being polite to those who are destroying america he turned weaknesses such as his spotty track record into strengths that would have ended any other candidates campaign he was the uncandidate america needed i have high hopes for trumps presidency in spite of my tepid support i see trump as a president who can do a lot of good and has the potential to do more good than any president of recent memory first trump spat in the face of pc culture and won just as scott walker took on the unions in wisconsin and cucked them by winning the recall election by getting more votes than he did in the previous election trump defeated the sjws if trump can keep this up we can achieve a major strategic victory in the war against political correctness and get back to a concept called actually being correct secondly trump is an unapologetic nationalist he loves america and doesnt give a damn if you think howard zinns a peoples history of the united states is a great book the department of cultural guilt that has infected schools in america teaches children to hate their own country i look forward to seeing trump abolish the practice of teaching children that the founding fathers were evil racists the british empire did nothing good for the world and that america is the greatest evil the world has ever seen lastly trump is the antithesis of everything the social justice warriors stand for a successful alpha male who tells people to go fuck themselves and still gets elected i hope to see a rise in masculinity in america studies have shown that testosterone levels are down among the american male population this should rise under trump as men embrace their masculinity instead of hiding it for fear of being accused of sexual assault i was a trump skeptic i underestimated him i didnt disagree with him on much perhaps maybe of his platform but i had little faith he could pull it off and i was vocal about my concerns regarding his electability but like the liberals i was wrong and a canadian housewife and a former pickupartistturnedconservativephilosopher were right i recall something i told a fellow soldier while on a long boring convoy operation in iraq when a genius says something others say wow that is way above my head but when a true genius says something others say wow why didnt i think of that before trump is a true genius he stated the obvious to the american people and made them believe he wanted to make america great again and i think he genuinely does he didnt use fancy graphs or focus groups he spoke the truth without political correctness and now he

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Wednesday ordered construction of a U.S.-Mexican border wall and punishment for cities shielding illegal immigrants while mulling restoring a CIA secret detention program as he launched broad but divisive plans to reshape U.S. immigration and national security policy. A draft executive order seen by Reuters that Trump is expected to sign in the coming days would block the entry of refugees from war-torn Syria and suspend the entry of any immigrants from Muslim-majority Middle Eastern and African countries Syria, Sudan, Somalia, Iraq, Iran, Libya and Yemen while permanent rules are studied. Less than a week into his presidency, Trump has moved aggressively to put his stamp on a range of policies, including steps to gut the healthcare system devised by his predecessor, and make clear that as president he is not turning toward more moderate positions than he took as a candidate. His directives on Wednesday signaled a tough action toward the roughly 11 million illegal immigrants already in the United States, most from Latin America, whom he already has threatened to deport. In a move critics called a slight to the integrity of American democracy, Trump also said on Wednesday he would seek a “major investigation” into what he believes was voter fraud in the November election, despite overwhelming consensus among state officials, election experts and politicians that it is rare in the United States. “We are going to restore the rule of law in the United States,” Trump told an audience that included relatives of people killed by illegal immigrants at the Department of Homeland Security after signing two executive orders. The directives ordered the construction of a multibillion-dollar wall along the roughly 2,000-mile (3,200-km) U.S.-Mexico border, moved to strip federal funding from “sanctuary” states and cities that harbor illegal immigrants, and expanded the force of American immigration agents. His plans prompted an outcry from immigrant advocates and Democratic lawmakers who said Trump was jeopardizing the rights and freedoms of millions of people while treating Mexico as an enemy, not an ally, and soiling America’s historic reputation as a welcoming place for immigrants of all stripes. “The border wall is about political theater at the expense of civil liberties,” said Christian Ramirez, director of the Southern Border Communities Coalition immigrant advocacy group. “It is not national security policy. Border communities are among the safest in the nation, and patrolling them with tens of thousands of heavily armed, poorly trained, unaccountable agents puts lives at risks. This will turn these communities into de facto military zones,” Ramirez said. The White House said the wall would stem the flow of drugs, crime and illegal immigration into the United States. “We are in the middle of a crisis on our southern border: The unprecedented surge of illegal migrants from Central America is harming both Mexico and the United States,” Trump said, adding: “A nation without borders is not a nation.” The immigration crackdown has sparked fear among so-called “dreamers,” whose parents brought them to the United States illegally and who received temporary deportation relief and work permits from President Barack Obama. Trump said the dreamers should not fear deportation. “They shouldn’t be very worried,” Trump told ABC News in an interview broadcast on Wednesday.. “Where you have great people that are here that have done a good job, they should be far less worried,” he said, adding: “We’ll be coming out with policy on that over the next period of four weeks.” House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan also said the “dreamers” should not be worried. “We’re focused on physical security of the border, we’re focused on those who are coming to do us harm from terrorist states and things like that,” he told MSNBC. Trump is also expected to order a review that could lead to bringing back a CIA program for holding terrorism suspects in secret overseas “black site” prisons where interrogation techniques often condemned as torture were used during former Republican President George W. Bush’s administration, two U.S. officials said. Trump’s actions could further test relations with Mexico. The wall plan has infuriated Mexicans. Trump’s policies, including his demand that the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada be renegotiated or scrapped, have put Mexico’s government on the defensive. Trump and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto are due to meet next week. Pena Nieto said on Wednesday night that he “regrets and disapproves” of the push by Trump to build a new wall along the border. Officials in cities such as New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, Boston, Denver, Washington, San Francisco and Seattle offer some forms of protection to illegal immigrants. Billions of dollars in federal aid to those cities, often governed by Democrats, could be at risk under Trump’s move. In the ABC News interview, Trump said construction on the wall would start within months, with planning starting immediately, and that Mexico would pay back to the United States “100 percent” of the costs. Mexican officials have said they will not pay for the wall. The White House said Trump’s goal was to get the wall started as quickly as possible using existing government funds and then work with the Republican-led Congress on further appropriations. Trump made cracking down on illegal immigration a key element of his presidential campaign, with supporters at his rallies often chanting: “Build the wall.” The cost, nature and extent of the wall remain unclear. Trump last year put the cost at “probably $8 billion,” although other estimates are higher, and he said the wall would span 1,000 miles (1,600 km) because of the terrain of the border. Trump’s directives would end the practice known by critics as “catch and release” in which authorities apprehend illegal immigrants on U.S. territory but do not immediately detain or deport them. The directives also include hiring 5,000 more U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents used to apprehend people seeking to slip across the border and tripling the number of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents used to arrest and deport immigrants living in the United States illegally. They also create more detention space for illegal immigrants along the southern border to make it easier to detain and deport them. The intent of the proposals regarding refugees and immigrants from the seven Muslim-majority nations is to head off Islamist violence in the United States. The draft directive on immigration also suspends the U.S. refugee program for four months while determining whether permanent changes to the system are needed.",1,fakenewsnet,,"Trump moves ahead with wall, puts stamp on U.S. immigration, security policy"

search election law violation was hillarys idea orders to use donald duck to foment violence at trump rallies came straight from the top october matthew vadum democrat hillary clinton personally authorized illegal dirty tricks operations against republican donald trumps campaign according to top democrats appearing in undercover video in the third hillaryrelated video released by acorn slayer james okeefe and his project veritas action fund this past sunday oct clinton is directly implicated in a scheme to use donald duck to mock trump and troll his supporters at trump campaign rallies among disney cartoon characters donald duck was a natural choice after all his name used to appear regularly on voter registration documents when bill and hillary clintons favorite community organizing group the nowdefunct acorn hired hobos and felons to go on voterregistration drives earlier this year democrats in donald duck costumes started appearing at trump events across america costumed individuals would walk around carrying signs one said trump ducks releasing his tax return this cutesy publicity stunt isnt necessarily the problem though the problem is that hillary clinton ordered it and apparently broke the law by coordinating with a taxexempt nonprofit group prominent in the video is political organizer robert creamer who is very high up in the democratic partys hierarchy he has reportedly visited the obama white house times including meetings with obama personally one of the visits took place in obamas personal living quarters its a very big deal that creamer visited the presidents residence in the white house a former senior white house employee told frontpage in an interview white house employees can work there for years and never visit the residence creamer a practitioner of the agitation arts taught by marxist community organizing guru saul alinsky is husband tof rep jan schakowsky dill a socialist and advocate of singlepayer health care creamer is considered by many to be the legislative architect of obamacare he also wrote a series of bad checks to cover his salary at a nonprofit and went to prison prosecutors wanted to send him up the river for months but he got off with merely five months and months of home confinement from a friendly democrat judge creamer is a founder of the unsavory political consulting firm democracy partners the list of partners on the companys website is a whos who of elite democratic party power players in addition to creamer the partners are midwest academy founder heather booth website developer marc cerabona organizer wyatt closs seiu veteran mac dalessandro maccabee group founder brett c di resta crosscurrents foundation cofounder ken grossinger former media matters for

associates are lauren windsor executive director of american family voices and aaron black who appears in the undercover videos black describes himself in the footage as basically deputy rapid response director for the dnc on the ground at trump events adding nobodys supposed to know about me frontpage published an article yesterday examining democracy partners for a master practitioner of fascistic tactics creamer is amazingly lacking in selfawareness or just plain dishonest he wrote a fatuous ahistorical oped in the huffington post earlier this year titled can fascism triumph in america like other fascist movements trump says out loud and legitimates the kind of hateful violent language that was previously whispered only in the privacy of peoples living rooms bear in mind that quite apart from his mischaracterization of trumps public statements creamer is shown in the videos masterminding an elaborate criminal conspiracy involving the use of targeted political violence against political opponents fomenting and carrying out acts of violence against political opponents was what the fascist third reich did using the sturmabteiling or sa also called brown shirts and storm troopers ditto for mussolinis squadristi black shirts maos red guards irans basij and haitis tonton macoute creamer explains the donald duck action in the third video in the end it was the candidate hillary clinton the future president of the united states who wanted ducks on the ground creamer says in one of several exchanges so by god we would get ducks on the ground creamer makes it clear he knows that this coordination between his consulting firm democracy partners and the campaign was a huge legal landmine when he said dont repeat that to anybody the whole duck thing that came about the reason we moved it from dnc to americans united for change was to just do a hopscotch but the actual idea was hatched way back in may creamer associate scott foval said making a pun the duck has to be an americans united for change entity creamer said this had to do only with some problem between now acting dnc chief donna brazile and abc which is owned by disney because they were worried about a trademark issue thats why its really silly we originally launched this duck because hillary clinton wants the duck in any case so she really wanted this duck figure out there doing stuff so that was fine so we put all these ducks out there and got a lot of coverage and trump taxes and then abcdisney went crazy because they thought our original slogan was donald ducks his taxes releasing his tax returns creamer is shown in the video hoping disney would file a lawsuit against democrats for using donald duck in the campaign likely because such a thing would generate publicity let them sue us please god he says looking to the heavens and clasping his hands together as if in prayer i doubt they will because were paying to rent or buy the suits thats where they get their license fees were not using it for commercial purposes the wall street journal reported aug that donald ducks was the creation of the democratic national committee then on sept the paper reported the dnc is no longer associated with the duck americans united for change is now managing the duck but out of public view the dnc and the clinton campaign were still controlling the duck operation breaking federal campaign coordination laws okeefe says in narrating the third video we kind of divvy up responsibilities so sometimes it will be like campaign owned said jenna price assistant press secretary at the dnc so sometimes you will see that they advised something or they are taking credit for things so like we arent taking credit for the duck anymore thats like random ally groups but its still something that were involved in brad woodhouse president of americans united for change expected the presence of the duck at events would spark violence i think this duck is going to get roughed up somewhere in one segment foval says i almost got punched on monday morning i mean i was in a duck costume the nations campaign coordination laws were enacted after president richard nixons watergate scandal okeefe notes for an activity to violate the law it must meet a threepart test he explains first there must be payment by someone other than the candidate for electionrelated activity second a campaign has to be materially involved in shaping communications for a third party group and third electoral advocacy has to take place close to an election okeefe continues the payment prong of the test is complicated but just the fact that foval a paid employee of americans united for change was the duck at some events constitutes payment by aufc conduct based on their own admission the campaign creamer their agent and aufc coordinated the duck activities and finally content donald ducks is undeniably political content directed against one candidate for the sole purpose of helping another the fourth video released yesterday isnt so much an expose of wrongdoing but it does provide ample evidence of creamers ties to the clinton campaign and to president obama himself in a phone call creamer says i spend most of my time overseeing the trump events around the country i mean thats what i do for the clinton campaign uh so thats interesting as well in another scene when an undercover reporter phones saying he needs an immigration lawyer with powerful connections for a wealthy client in syria creamer makes it clear he is happy to help by reaching out to obamas inner circle i just need to i will try and find a couple of good referrals to you and get back to you pretty quick then okay on the first well ill just talk the guy im going to talk to first to see if this is up his alley the first thing is up his alley its the guy who ran the campaign for president obama he has a firm thats pretty well connected in another setting creamer says heres what i do for the clinton campaign by the way im a consultant to the clinton campaign wherever trump or pence go in the country we make sure that there are press events in the tv market or whatever whether theyre big turnouts or little turnouts whatever that drive our message wherever the candidate goes to drive his message so that on any given day they will be between them probably in six places so our team makes sure there are events in all those six places every day so it is a lot of events and we try and help define the other candidate every morning i am on a call at that goes over the message being driven by the campaign headquarters added creamer he continued im in this campaign mainly to deal with what you know earned media with the television radio with earned media and social media not with paid media not with advertising there would be a whole different advertising everybody is driven on the same tracks though so then there are a couple a bunch of people in the brooklyn office of the clinton campaign that are responsible for possible aspects of communication like we do rapid response and there is a guy there i work with heavily is the guy that i was just communicating with on that kind of stuff for instance we just found i just sent him a note beforehand when we came here that said my understanding is there might be another revelation of another woman talking about trump this afternoon creamer bragged again about his ties to president obama oh barack obamas was the best campaign in the history of american politics i mean the second one i mean the first was good too i was a consultant to both the second one was everything hit on every level and every aspect obama is a pro creamer said ive known the president since he was a community organizer in chicago i was just at an event with him in chicago actually on friday last he is just as good as ever i do a lot of work with the white house on their issues helping to run issue campaigns that they have been involved in i mean for immigration reform for the the health care bill trying to make america more like britain when it comes to gun violence issues the second video released oct was a primer on how democrats get away with massive voter fraud its a very easy thing for republicans to say well theyre bussing people in said scott foval then national field director for americans united for change well you know what weve been bussing people in to deal with you fuckin assholes for years and were not going to stop now were just going to find a different way to do it so i mean i grew up with that idea they used to bus people out to iowa if we needed people out there wed bus people out to iowa in a discussion okeefe described as focusing on bringing people from one state to another state to vote illegally foval who also worked as deputy political director at george sorosfunded people for the american way pfaw explains how to get away with voter fraud instead of bussing people in it is better to have them travel

"Republican presidential hopeful and Texas senator Ted Cruz has earned the nickname Lyin Ted for a reason, and he s in no rush to clean up his tarnished image anytime soon.Proving that he s completely worthy of being known as the least-liked GOPer, Cruz mingled with voters at The Pie Pan restaurant in Evansville this weekend and lied to their faces. For over an hour, Cruz met and took photos with voters, clearly trying to prove that he wasn t Lucifer, as former House Speaker John Boehner recently suggested.During this meet-and-greet, one of the issues Cruz spoke about was Obamacare. Cruz said: The top two legislative agenda items I ve got are repealing Obamacare and passing a simple flat tax, abolishing the IRS. Everything was going smoothly for Cruz until toward the end of his visit, when an older couple introduced Cruz to Scott, a disabled man in a wheelchair. Although some of the conversation is muffled, it is clear that the man is concerned about the Affordable Care Act being repealed, stating that people like him would not be able to get health insurance at all. This concern is completely valid even current House Speaker Paul Ryan has said that putting people with pre-existing conditions into high-risk pools would make healthcare unaffordable for many Americans. Cruz began to respond and say, There s no doubt that we need to provide care before the man interrupted: But it was never done before. It was never done. Nobody did it. Cruz, heartless as ever, replied with a straight-up lie: I can tell you millions have lost their health care at the same time. The millions that Cruz is referring to are those who had policies that didn t meet Obamacare standards. Factcheck.org has actually straightened this false GOP talking point right out it turns out that those people didn t lose their insurance at all they were offered replacements that did fall in line with the ACA instead. But of course, Cruz isn t going to bother with the truth.You can watch Cruz lie to a disabled man s face below:The feed unfortunately cut out, but not before the man confronting Cruz could point to Scott and say, Well, but it made a difference to some. Those some people who the man is referring to are the 16.9 million Americans that now have affordable health insurance thanks to the Affordable Care Act. Repealing Obamacare is a huge disservice to Americans, and it s a shame that Cruz s attitude toward those concerns is I don t give a f*ck.

"BERLIN (Reuters) - German police presented on Tuesday diaries, pairs of glasses and other items belonging to late Beatle John Lennon that were stolen from his widow Yoko Ono in 2006 and eventually ended up in Berlin. Police arrested a man in Berlin on Monday suspected of receiving the 86 stolen items, which include Lennon s last diary that ended on the day he was shot and killed in New York on Dec. 8, 1980. This day contains the entry that on that morning John Lennon and Yoko Ono had an appointment with Annie Leibovitz to take a photo which I think is world famous, Berlin prosecutor Michael von Hagen told a news conference. The Leibovitz portrait of a naked Lennon curled up around Ono on their bed ran on the January 1981 cover of Rolling Stone magazine. Hagen rejected suggestions that Ono might have lent or given away the objects: The diaries especially ... were also treated by Yoko Ono as something sacred. And the idea that she would have given away three original diaries, especially the one that ends on the very day Lennon died, can be completely ruled out. Carsten Pfohl, head of property crime for Berlin police, said investigators had found one of the pairs of glasses and a receipt in Lennon s name hidden in the trunk of the car of the accused on Monday. Police suspect that the items were stolen by Ono s former driver and then taken to Turkey and were only brought to Berlin in 2013 or 2014. Another suspect lives in Turkey, they said.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives ramped up their efforts to force the release of President Donald Trump’s tax returns, calling it a critical issue of transparency and national security. House Democrats said they would use a parliamentary procedure to file a petition aimed at forcing a vote on legislation requiring U.S. presidents to disclose multiple years of federal income tax filings. Representatives for the White House and House Speaker Paul Ryan did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Trump, a Republican and New York real estate developer who touted his business acumen in the 2016 presidential campaign, defied decades of precedent by candidates when he refused to release his tax returns, saying they were under audit. The Internal Revenue Service says audits pose no obstacle to releasing tax returns. Democrats, for their so-called discharge petition to move forward, would need to obtain signatures of support from the majority of the 435 lawmakers in the Republican-controlled House. Such a move could be a long-shot given that just two Republicans, Representatives Mark Sanford and Justin Amash, have signed on to sponsor the proposed bill that would then see a vote. The petition is the latest effort by Democrats on the issue as just two glimpses of Trump’s taxes have surfaced in media reports on his 1995 and 2005 filings. Democrats say Trump’s taxes are a national security issue given congressional investigations into possible ties between Russia and his campaign. They also cite concerns over potential conflicts of interest with his privately held global businesses. “How do we know when he makes policy decisions or, you know, trade deals ... with foreign countries that he is looking out for the American people and not lining his own pockets?” Democratic Representative Bill Pascrell said to reporters.",1,fakenewsnet,,House Democrats press Trump to release tax returns
"How quickly the Democrats and their allies in the media forget, that when the bear is poked, he fights back. Donald Trump has never been shy about punching back when he s being unfairly attacked, and Democrat Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (NY) is no exception.

He was begging me, Trump said.Trump was referring to the 2012 race for president in which Romney, the GOP nominee that year, sought Trump s endorsement.But if they were friendly four years ago, that relationship has clearly deteriorated.Earlier Thursday, Romney gave a speech in which he railed against Trump, whom he called a fraud, con man, phony, and fake, among other things. His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University, Romney jabbed. He s playing the American public for suckers. He gets a free ride to the White House, and all we get is a lousy hat. Throughout Trump s subsequent speech in Maine, the real-estate developer repeatedly and extensively lashed back out at Romney. Mitt is a failed candidate he failed badly, Trump said. That is a race that should have been won. He repeatedly called Romney a choke artist throughout the speech, an insult he s used against Marco Rubio, a top Trump rival for the 2016 nomination. He s a choke artist, I started hitting him so hard, Trump said. We can t take another loss. He choked, he choked like nobody I ve ever seen except for Rubio, he continued.At other points in his speech, Trump called Romney a disaster candidate in 2012.

"The Republican Party is an absolute mess and we re starting to reap the benefits.While the GOP has spent Obama s entire presidency attempting to do nothing to help the country, they ve recently taken it so far that they hardly bother to show up at the Capitol at all. This is creating some really, really stupid problems.It s easy to see why House Speaker Paul Ryan was reluctant to take the job because one of the unenviable tasks he s expected to do is to somehow trick the hundreds of Republican lawmakers he leads into actually doing their jobs once in a while. It s not easy.Recently, an increasingly frustrated Ryan even told Congress that they needed to make more of an effort to show up on time for legislative votes. The process is supposed to take 15 minutes, but with lawmakers slowly trickling in when they feel like it, oftentimes it can go on for an eternity. (If you re getting the sense that lawmakers are behaving worse than high school students dragging their feet to homeroom, you re not the only one.) The lack of urgency means Congress hardly gets anything done. Members should be reminded, members should attempt to come to the floor within the 15-minute period as prescribed by the first ring of the bells. All sides of the aisle, Ryan said. As a point of courtesy to each of your colleagues, voting within the allotted time would help with the maintenance of the institution. The chair appreciates the members attention to this matter, he said with a smile.Apparently, nobody listened, least of all Ryan s fellow Republicans.When it came time for Republicans to vote on a measure meant to derail Obama s historic nuclear deal with Iran, over 130 lawmakers, mostly Republicans, were visibly absent. It appears that voting for a thing they themselves had introduced had slipped their minds. An unhappy Ryan slammed down his gavel after 15 minutes and abruptly ended voting which vacated the tally due to insufficient votes.How big of a screw up was this for Republicans? The window to truly derail Obama s Iranian deal closed with Ryan s gavel. They blew it. Instead, Secretary of State John Kerry says America will begin upholding its obligations to the deal starting in a matter of days, barring any setbacks from Iran. Implementation day, which is the day on which Iran proves that it has sufficiently downsized its nuclear program and can begin to receive sanctions relief, is going to take place very soon, likely within the next coming days somewhere. In a supreme irony, many Republican lawmakers were probably catching up on sleep after spending last night giving breathless interviews disingenuously spreading the lies that Iran was holding American Navy service members hostage. As usual, their lofty rhetoric doesn t match their actions. If Iran was really so dangerous and they cared so much for the troops, would skipping this vital vote really be an option?Yet another example that the dysfunction in Washington stems largely from the Republican Party. As the right-wing movement continues to become swallowed by anti-government extremists who were once considered the radical fringe, even doing the jobs you were elected to do say, pass legislation can paint you as a RINO. Instead, many Republican lawmakers try their best to destroy the government from the inside by willfully throwing wrenches into the works. But as we ve seen, this scorched earth approach can backfire. During those times when Republicans actually do want to accomplish something, they fall apart. We see it here.Another Republican chance to hurt Obama goes down in flames by a needless unforced error due to stupidity, apathy, and laziness. What a legacy this Congress is building for itself. Republicans ought to be so proud.Feature image via io9",0,fakenewsnet,, GOP Bill To Derail Iran Deal Goes Down In Flames After 100+ Republicans Forget To Show Up To Vote
"(Reuters) - Myanmar stands accused by rights groups of ethnic cleansing and human rights violations after violence broke out in the northwestern state of Rakhine, triggering an exodus of about 400,000 Rohingya Muslims to southern Bangladesh. At least 400 people have been killed, and thousands of homes and villages have been torched, since the military launched a counteroffensive against Rohingya insurgents in late August. Myanmar does not recognize the roughly 1.1 million Rohingyas as citizens, leaving them effectively stateless. The following are questions and answers on the violence: The military says it is protecting Myanmar against attacks by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), which it has labeled a terrorist group and accuses of killings and destruction in Rakhine state. Human rights monitors and fleeing Rohingya say the army and ethnic Rakhine Buddhist vigilantes have mounted a campaign of arson aimed at driving out the Rohingya. Rights groups say an independent investigation is required to determine possible abuses or violations by various parties. Yes, according to United Nations officials and rights groups. Top U.N. officials have said the violence in Myanmar is a case of textbook ethnic cleansing . The U.N. has in the past defined ethnic cleansing as rendering an area ethnically homogeneous by using force or intimidation to remove persons of given groups from the area. Ethnic cleansing is not recognized as a separate crime under international law. But allegations of ethnic cleansing as part of wider, systematic human rights violations have been heard in international courts against individuals - including former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, who was convicted of genocide. Phil Robertson, deputy director for Asia at Human Rights Watch (HRW), said initial investigations in Myanmar were indicative of an ethnic cleansing campaign . When an army is burning people out of their villages all over northern Rakhine state and using violence against civilians, it results in the kind of incredible refugee flows we re seeing, he added. Myanmar has denied allegations of ethnic cleansing. ARE WE SEEING GENOCIDE, WAR CRIMES, CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY? Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has said the killing of hundreds of Rohingya amounted to genocide, but rights groups have so far stayed away from these labels, because all three categories are clearly defined and covered in international law. For the ongoing violence to be considered war crimes, the parties involved would have to be at war. Currently, experts say, Myanmar is not technically at war because it only has one party - the military - that is organized enough to carry out intensive fighting operations. We have not yet been able to determine whether a state of war is present in Rakhine state, said HRW s Robertson. Crimes against humanity and genocide could be taking place even in the absence of war, but, under U.N. definitions, there would need to be proof of other conditions such as broader, systematic attacks against the Rohingyas. Human rights groups have accused Myanmar of laying anti-personnel mines along the border with Bangladesh to prevent Rohingya refugees from returning to Rakhine state. Because the crisis is not currently defined as a war, this cannot be considered a war crime, according to experts. However it would violate other international human rights laws, even though Myanmar is not party to the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty. For nations that are not parties to the treaty, the use of anti-personnel mines violates customary international law, because the weapons are inherently indiscriminate and cause disproportionate long-term harm to civilians, said Richard Weir, a legal expert at HRW. A Myanmar military source told Reuters that landmines were laid along the border in the 1990s to prevent trespassing and the military had since tried to remove them, but that none had been planted recently. In international law, an individual can be held criminally responsible for when a state or military commits war crimes or crimes against humanity. Rights groups have called for an independent investigation of abuses by all parties, including ARSA. Many believe the government and the military should be held responsible. Myanmar is systematically violating the rights of the Rohingya ... and both the government and the military now need to suffer serious consequences for this, said HRW s Robertson. This depends on the findings of an independent investigation, if the Myanmar government allows one to take place, experts say. Rights groups have called for the U.N. Security Council to also reprimand Myanmar in other ways, for instance, by imposing sanctions such as an arms embargo. They have also urged countries, including the United States and Australia, to suspend bilateral military ties. The 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner has faced widespread international criticism for not doing enough to protect the Rohingya community. Suu Kyi has no direct control over the military, which remains powerful under Myanmar s army-written constitution. But she is Myanmar s foreign minister and de facto civilian leader and has defended the military operation. It s premature to speculate, said Robertson, adding that individual responsibility should be based on an impartial investigation. The International Criminal Court (ICC), based in The Hague, Netherlands, has the jurisdiction to prosecute crimes of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. Myanmar is among the countries, which also include the United States and China, that are not signatory to the treaty that created the ICC, so it is not obligated to cooperate. But if the U.N. Security Council were to refer a case to the court then Myanmar, being a member of the U.N., would be subject to its jurisdiction. Ad hoc tribunals and commissions have been set up in the past to hear cases of mass human rights violations. For instance, the United Nations established the International Criminal Tribunals for Yugoslavia and Rwanda to deal with crimes that took place there. Rights groups say they are protected by various U.N. human rights treaties, primarily the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which Myanmar voted for in 1948. The document includes provisions for the right to life and right to a nationality - particularly relevant to the Rohingyas, who are effectively stateless.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions plans to announce soon several criminal investigations into intelligence leaks, news outlets reported on Wednesday, as the country’s top law enforcement official faced mounting criticism from President Donald Trump. The announcement has “been in the works for some time and will most likely happen sometime in the next week,” Fox News reported, citing an unnamed U.S. official. The Washington Post also reported the planned announcement, citing multiple unnamed officials. The investigations will look at news stories that publicized sensitive intelligence material, according to the reports. Officials at the U.S. Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment. On Tuesday, Trump tweeted that Sessions has not aggressively pursued people who leaked intelligence secrets during his time in office, one of a series of criticisms apparently aimed at pushing the former Republican Alabama senator to step down. Trump also said again that he was frustrated that Sessions had recused himself from a federal investigation into possible collusion between Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and Russia, but stopped short of saying whether he would fire him. Top Republican lawmakers have rallied to Sessions’ defense as allies of the attorney general said Trump appeared to be trying to pressure him to quit by repeatedly criticizing him on Twitter and in interviews. The latest apparent leak involved Sessions himself. On Friday, the Washington Post reported that Russia’s ambassador to Washington was overheard via surveillance by U.S. spy agencies telling his bosses that he had discussed campaign-related matters, including issues important to Moscow, with Sessions during the 2016 presidential race. The newspaper cited current and former U.S. officials familiar with U.S. intelligence intercepts. Earlier this month, a report written by Republican members of the Senate’s homeland security panel said the Trump administration faced an “alarming” amount of media leaks that posed potential danger to national security and urged law enforcement officials to step up their investigations. Separately, Trump’s new communications director, Anthony Scaramucci, told Fox News on Wednesday he expected Trump would soon announce a plan to stem leaks, adding that there seemed to be some “political holdovers from the Obama administration that are not helping.” Scaramucci said he recognized it was “impossible” to eliminate leaks in Washington but added: “We’re going to try and hit a cultural reset on these leaks not only here in the White House, but I’m going to be working with the agencies and the departments to do that.” “Now one of the big problems here that I’m discovering in the (communications) team is that senior people are really the guys doing the leaking and they ask junior people to leak for them,” Scaramucci told Fox News in a separate interview later on Wednesday. On Tuesday, he told reporters on Air Force One after Trump’s trip to Ohio that he would probably restructure the communications operation at the White House and fire staff if leaks did not cease: “If the leaks continue, then I’ve got to let everybody go.” Scaramucci said there were no immediate plans to fire anyone else following the resignation of senior assistant press secretary Michael Short earlier on Tuesday.

Once a government makes the decision to open its borders to anyone who cares to come in and to support them, regardless of the size of family, or age of the wife (or in many cases multiple wives), it s very hard to turn off the government spigot Politicians in Denmark have condemned the asylum seeker policy which will allow Daham Al Hasan to rake in thousands in benefits once his huge family is reunited.The 47-year-old fled war-torn Syria two years ago with a wife and eight children before arriving in Denmark.The unemployed migrant, who claims to be too sick to work, has now been granted family reunification for his remaining 12 children and two wives who are still in Syria.The migrant also said the pain was so overwhelming that he could not learn Danish yet.The approval will see the Danish taxpayer fork out 214,128 Danish Kroners ( 21,883) in child support for the family each year.Outraged officials have raised concerns about the policy and suggested the Syrian man is exploiting the country s welfare system.Integration spokesperson for the Conservatives, Naser Khader, said: It is highly problematic that a Syrian refugee can be allowed to call himself sick to avoid working and learning Danish, so he can support 20 children. The politician added it should not be possible for someone who does not intend to work to be given such vast sums and called for Denmark to implement an upper limit for the number of children a person can claim contributions for.Shader said: We need to save and it can t be right that a man, who has not contributed, is granted hundreds of thousands in child support.

"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Chicago is starting an advertising campaign to reassure immigrants that they are welcome in the third-largest U.S. city, in a show of defiance to a crackdown by President Donald Trump on people who have entered the country illegally. Mayor Rahm Emanuel said on Monday he was not worried about the “One Chicago” campaign upsetting the Trump administration. Starting this week, signs will appear at more than 200 locations including digital billboards, trains and newspaper racks with photos of Chicago immigrants highlighting the diversity of their backgrounds. Radio and TV spots will start this week with similar stories. A new website, onechi.org, features links for free legal aid and “know your rights” training.The campaign’s slogan is “Three million residents, three million stories, one Chicago.” The mayor’s office said the campaign was costing taxpayers nothing. The advertising was designed on a pro-bono basis by the ad agency Ogilvy Chicago and uses city-owned public-service advertising space. “I’m not worried because we’re not only on firm legal ground but firm moral ground,” Emanuel said. “We’re all immigrants and we’re not going to let them divide us and say that person is not allowed here.” Trump already has threatened to withhold federal funds from cities such as Chicago that offer sanctuary to illegal immigrants who commit no serious crimes. The Justice Department in April singled out Chicago and New York, saying they were “crumbling under the weight of illegal immigration and violent crime,” even though experts say illegal immigration had little to do with Chicago’s spike in murders. Last month, a U.S. judge blocked a portion of Trump’s executive order that sought to withhold most federal funds from so-called sanctuary cities as part of the administration’s efforts to toughen immigration enforcement. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memo on Monday saying that only Department of Justice and Homeland Security grants would be at risk for cities that “willfully refuse” to comply with federal law. Sanctuary cities generally offer safe harbor to illegal immigrants and often do not use municipal funds or resources to advance the enforcement of federal immigration laws. Emanuel, whose grandparents came to the United States as immigrants from Moldova, said the campaign was meant to reassure those feeling frightened about deportation. Chicago officials estimates there are about 300,000 undocumented immigrants in the city. “I see it with kids all across Chicago – they are nervous about their parents and nervous about their own safety because of the government and the rhetoric,” he said.",1,fakenewsnet,,Chicago launches ad campaign to counter Trump's immigration efforts

"There are moments in life when you have to admit you made mistakes. However, for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, this is not one of those moments. To be blunt, he s having a very bad week. Not only is Christie no longer in the running for the White House, he made the bizarre choice to endorse Donald Trump on the same weekend that Trump wouldn t disavow the Ku Klux Klan. And it even seems as if Trump isn t that thrilled with the support, telling Christie that he should just go home. Christie claims he s proud to support Trump, but his actions at a recent press conference suggest otherwise. He insisted that he only be asked questions that were on-topic, and anytime he was asked about Trump he would go off into a rehearsed non-answer to avoid the subject. He said things, such as: No, I won t permit you to. I told you that there s going to be only on-topic questions today. So, permission denied. That s an off-topic question. I think you understand that I m answering on-topic questions today. And then when asked why he wouldn t answer any questions related to Trump, he responded with the maturity level of a four-year-old being asked to eat his peas: Because I don t want to. At this point the New Jersey governor should just go back to his state to take care of business instead of try to hold on to whatever remaining spotlight he can. He should do so not only for his state, but also for his dignity.Christie, back away slowly while you still can and do your job. Both your state and your nation will appreciate it.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The failure by President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans to dismantle Obamacare has infuriated the party’s conservative flank and is intensifying intra-party warfare ahead of the 2018 U.S. congressional elections. Donors and activists upset by the collapse of the latest Senate healthcare bill said it hardened their determination to back conservative candidates in next year’s elections, even if that means ousting Republican incumbents. “I am fed up. I’m beyond frustrated,” said Mica Mosbacher, a Houston-based Republican fundraiser, who added she was “extremely disappointed in Ted Cruz,” a Republican U.S. senator from Texas who had threatened to oppose the latest healthcare bill because he wanted to see changes. Texas is scheduled to hold the first nominating primary of the midterm elections in March 2018. Trump vowed during the 2016 election campaign to scrap the 2010 Affordable Care Act, former Democratic President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement, which Republicans see as a costly government overreach. Democrats say it has extended health insurance to millions. The latest bill to overturn Obamacare failed on Tuesday after three Senate Republicans, including moderate Susan Collins and conservative Rand Paul, said they could not support it. Republicans narrowly control the chamber by 52-48. In November 2018, all 435 seats of the U.S. House of Representatives and 33 seats in the Senate will be up for election. In the Senate, that includes 23 Democrats and eight Republicans, with several in both parties in fights expected to be competitive. If a large number of Republicans are forced to defend their seats against challengers from their own party in primary fights, Democrats will seek to exploit weakened candidates in the general election in their effort to wrest control of the House and Senate from Republicans. A shift of either chamber into Democratic hands would make it even more difficult for Trump to pass his agenda of tax reform, toughening immigration laws and rolling back Obamacare. Republicans have not delivered a significant legislative win on any topic since Trump took office in January. Mosbacher said she was “leaning toward supporting” Cruz’s primary opponent, Stefano de Stefano, even though she served as fundraiser for the incumbent’s 2012 campaign. Whoever prevails in that fight would likely face Beto O’Rourke, a well-funded Democrat, in the general election. Texas last elected a Democrat to the Senate in 1988. The conservative group Club For Growth has already begun interviewing Republican primary challengers it will consider backing next year. “We’ll continue to push for full repeal of Obamacare, and we’re disappointed Republicans have been unable to deliver on their seven-year promise,” said Rachael Slobodien, a spokeswoman for Club for Growth. Club for Growth is not alone in its frustration over the defeat of the Obamacare repeal effort. David Bozell, president of ForAmerica, a conservative grassroots organization, said incumbents who failed to line up solidly behind repeal had “shown some true colors” and in doing so, were inviting primary fights for their party’s nomination. Republican Senators Jeff Flake of Arizona and Dean Heller of Nevada are top targets for conservative groups. Conservative Kelli Ward has already announced her candidacy challenging Flake, and is seeking to amass support as a more conservative option. Dave Tamasi, a Republican lobbyist and fundraiser, said he thought it was too soon to know if the healthcare failure would hurt Republicans. “Opponents may try to use today or the failure to pass a repeal of the Affordable Care Act to give their candidacy a little bit of a push. The question is can that fuel today sustain itself over the long term of an election cycle,” he said. So far, Trump has been hedging his bets on the Republican primaries. But many of his allies are already backing conservative primary challengers. Trump has blasted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell over Congress’ inaction. Such criticisms could help turn next year’s elections into a referendum on congressional incumbents, rather than on the president himself. “I think we are entering an era of more primary challenges in general, The disappointment by activists over the inability for Republicans to repeal Obamacare only adds fuel to this fire,” said Craig Robinson, former political director of the Iowa Republican Party.",1,fakenewsnet,,U.S. healthcare bill's collapse escalates Republican infighting

"(Reuters) - The Trump administration on Friday dropped a lawsuit accusing North Carolina of discriminating against LGBT residents after the state replaced its “bathroom bill”, although a key civil liberties group vowed to keep fighting the new law in court. In a two-sentence court filing the Justice Department said it had dropped its lawsuit, filed last year by the Obama administration, because the North Carolina legislature had replaced it with a new law called House Bill 142. The filing marks the first significant move in a complicated legal battle challenging the state’s nondiscrimination laws since the replacement of the original law, known as House Bill 2 or more commonly as the “bathroom bill.” House Bill 2’s most controversial provision was the requirement that in state-run buildings transgender people use the bathrooms, changing rooms and showers that corresponded to the sex on their birth certificates rather than their gender identity. A number of businesses and sports leagues boycotted North Carolina because they saw the year-old law as discriminatory against the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community. Civil liberties groups also protested the move. The American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of North Carolina, and Lambda Legal filed a lawsuit challenging the law in March of last year. That was followed in May by the Justice Department’s own suit against House Bill 2. James Esseks, the ACLU’s LGBT Project Director said the new law is flawed because it keeps a ban on cities and counties from creating their own nondiscriminatory ordinaces until 2020 and relegates to the state legislature the power to regulate bathroom access. The legislature has purposefully not taken any action to define access, he said. House Bill 142 “leaves transgender people in limbo and that’s intentional,” Esseks said. “This does not fix the problem. It creates confusion.” Esseks said his group planned to amend their lawsuit soon to challenge the new bill.",1,fakenewsnet,,Trump administration drops North Carolina 'bathroom bill' lawsuit

see the next two months are an absolutely critical time and if we can get through january th without something major happening perhaps we can breathe a little bit easier at least for a while on the other hand the events of the next two months could easily plunge this country into a period of unprecedented chaos a lot of people are feeling really good about things right now because of trumps

however they can vote for hillary clinton if they choose even in states where that is not allowed their vote would still be counted they would simply pay a small fine which we can be sure clinton supporters will be glad to pay we are calling on the electors to ignore their states votes and cast their ballots for secretary clinton personally i dont believe that this is going to happen they may be able to flip a few electors but the gap in electoral votes is almost certainly too wide for the democrats to overcome however that is not the only concern we are facing ever since his victory on

way to keep donald trump from getting to inauguration day so let us pray for his safety and for the safety of his family if donald trump were to be incapacitated after he wins the electoral college vote on december th mike pence would take his place but if something were to happen to him before december th his electors would be free to vote for another candidate including hillary clinton if everything goes smoothly and donald trump successfully makes it to inauguration day he could be facing one of the biggest political protests in united states history in an article for the most important news i showed that the far left is calling for thousands upon thousands of protesters to descend upon washington dc on january th in order to disrupt the inauguration festivities as much as possible this giant protest is being organized by the usual suspects and they have already put up facebook pages websites and the hashtag disruptj is being widely used all over social media traditionally inauguration day is a day of joy and celebration but the far left seems intent on transforming it into a massive riot let us hope that they are not successful another reason why we will be in the danger zone over the next two months is because of what barack obama may choose to do at the united nations now that it looks like donald trump is going to be our next president the international pressure on barack obama to do something at the united nations regarding the israelipalestinian conflict before the end of his term has become even more intense and this is something that trump and his advisers are actively concerned about in fact i came across an article earlier today that discussed the fact that the trump team is warning obama against making moves on the israelipalestinian conflict in his last months in office saying that pushing agendas contrary to the presidentelects position would not be in the spirit of the transition trump national security advisor for donald trump last week warned the obama administration against making moves on the israelipalestinian conflict in his last months in office on big transformative issues where president obama and presidentelect trump are not in alignment i dont think its in keeping with the spirit of the transitionto try to push through agenda items that are contrary to the presidentelects positions the advisor told politico specifically the concern is that obama may decide to support a un security council resolution that would officially recognize a palestinian state set the parameters for a two state solution and establish east jerusalem as the capital for the new palestinian state just a few weeks ago an article in the wall street journal entitled obamas israel surprise reported that this is one of the options that the obama administration is strongly considering right now a un security council resolution would be legally binding on both israel and the palestinians and it would be something that president trump would not be able to undo the rest of the un security council is eager to support such a resolution and so the decision about whether this resolution is going to happen or not sits in the hands of barack obama and at this moment we do not know what he is going to do the following comes from an article by leo hohmann the wall street journal reported one week before tuesdays election that obama had requested his aides provide him with a list of options to deal with the decadesold israelipalestinian conflict israeli diplomats according to the wsj story are preparing for the possibility that a lameduck president obama may try to force a diplomatic resolution for israel and the palestinians at the united nations the president is presumably now reviewing those options which number about half a dozen he may be preparing to recognize a palestinian state at the un before he leaves office wsj reported if barack obama decides to divide the land of israel at the united nations it will be the worst decision of his entire presidency i have warned repeatedly that all hell will break loose in america if it happens and it will also mean that many of the events that i warn about in my latest book are much closer than many had been anticipating but if we can get to january th and the land of israel has not been divided yet we may be able to rest easy for at least a little while because trump has already said that he would not support a un security council resolution that forces a solution on the israelis and palestinians when politicians are going to do something that they know people wont like they tend to try to sneak it through around the holidays when a lot of people arent paying attention for example yesterday i discussed how the legislation that created the federal reserve was rushed through congress right before christmas in so keep an eye on the period around thanksgiving and the period around christmas if barack obama is going to stab israel in the back it may happen during one of those times my hope is that we can get through january th without anything going seriously wrong if that happens i know that i will be very thankful and as i detailed in a previous article donald trump will be years months and days old on his first full day in office on january st and that will happen in year on the hebrew calendar could that be a sign of better things ahead as many believe or will the next two months set off a chain of events that will be absolutely disastrous for this nation i believe that this is an absolutely critical moment in our history and let us hope that our leaders make the right decisions danger zone brings back memories of kenny loggins and top gun anonymous listen to her howlin roar metal under

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch on Tuesday pledged independence from President Donald Trump, bristled at his criticism of the judiciary and said not even the president is above the law amid Democratic concerns he would be beholden to the man who selected him. Answering questions from senators during a more than 11-hour session on the second day of his Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing, Gorsuch said Trump never asked him to overturn the 1973 Supreme Court ruling legalizing abortion nationwide, saying if the Republican president had done so, “I would have walked out the door.” Trump promised during last year’s presidential campaign to appoint an anti-abortion justice who would overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling, which many conservatives want reversed. If confirmed by the Senate as expected to fill a 13-month-old vacancy, Gorsuch would restore the nine-seat court's conservative majority at a time when Republicans control Congress and the White House. But the conservative federal appeals court judge from Colorado repeatedly said he was beyond politics. (GRAPHIC - Confirming Gorsuch: How it works tmsnrt.rs/2mB9WPR) “When I became a judge, they gave me a gavel not a rubber stamp,” Gorsuch said. “I am my own man,” he added. Trump has assailed the judiciary both as a candidate and since taking office on Jan. 20. He condemned federal judges who put on hold his two executive orders to ban the entry into the United States of people from several Muslim-majority countries, calling one a “so-called judge” and suggesting that blame for a future terrorist attack should go to the courts. “When anyone criticizes the honesty or integrity or the motives of a federal judge, well I find that disheartening, I find that demoralizing, because I know the truth,” Gorsuch said. When Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal asked if that included Trump, Gorsuch said, “Anyone is anyone.” Gorsuch previously made similar remarks in private to senators including Blumenthal, but Trump at the time accused Blumenthal of misrepresenting Gorsuch’s comments. Trump indicated in a speech on Tuesday night that his approach was unlikely to change. “The courts are not helping us, to be honest, it’s ridiculous. Somebody said I should not criticize judges, OK, I’ll criticize judges,” he said. Gorsuch’s steady, measured performance during the marathon session, marked by a few moments of indignation under Democratic questioning, indicated he was on track for confirmation. Democrats probed Gorsuch on whether he would be willing to hold Trump accountable. Asked by Senator Patrick Leahy whether a president has the power to violate a law on surveillance of Americans, Gorsuch said, “Nobody is above the law in this country, and that includes the president of the United States.” Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said if Trump resumes the use of waterboarding, a prohibited form of simulated drowning, on detainees, he “may get impeached.” Gorsuch said he would not speculate on whether Trump could be prosecuted if he authorized waterboarding, but repeated, “No man is above the law.” Republicans have praised Gorsuch, 49, as highly qualified for a lifetime appointment as a justice. Democrats, who have slim chances of blocking his nomination, have questioned his suitability, with some portraying him as favoring corporate interests and insufficiently independent from Trump. Chuck Grassley, the panel’s Republican chairman, asked Gorsuch “whether you’d have any trouble ruling against a president who appointed you.” “That’s a softball, Mr. Chairman,” Gorsuch said. “I have no difficulty ruling against or for any party, other than based on what the law and facts in the particular case require. And I’m heartened by the support I have received from people who recognize that there’s no such thing as a Republican judge or a Democratic judge. We just have judges in this country.” “I have offered no promises on how I’d rule in any case to anyone. And I don’t think it’s appropriate for a judge to do so, no matter who’s doing the asking,” Gorsuch added. Gorsuch refused to offer his opinion of Trump’s travel ban, saying it was an ongoing case. When Leahy brought up a Republican lawmaker’s suggestion that Gorsuch would uphold Trump’s ban, the nominee said, “A lot of people say a lot of silly things” and that lawmaker “has no idea how I’d rule.” Gorsuch said rulings should be based on the law and not politics, adding, “A good judge doesn’t give a whit about politics or the political implications of his or her decision.” Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse pressed Gorsuch to call for the anonymous financial backers behind the Judicial Crisis Network conservative legal advocacy group’s $10 million campaign supporting his nomination to identify themselves, but the nominee refused, saying he would not engage in politics. But Gorsuch added, “Nobody speaks for me.” The seat Gorsuch was nominated to fill has been vacant since the February 2016 death of conservative justice Antonin Scalia. Some Democrats have said Republicans “stole” a Supreme Court seat last year when the Senate refused to consider former Democratic President Barack Obama’s nominee to replace Scalia, appellate judge Merrick Garland. Questioned by Leahy, Gorsuch called Garland an “outstanding judge,” but refused to answer whether Obama’s nominee had been treated fairly by Senate Republicans. Gorsuch said Supreme Court precedents deserve respect, even as he sidestepped answering whether he thought a series of contentious cases from the past had been decided correctly, including Roe v. Wade and cases on gun rights, political spending, religious rights and the ruling tipping the 2000 presidential election to Republican George W. Bush. Gorsuch did say that the issue of gay marriage, which the Supreme Court legalized in 2015, was “absolutely settled law.” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told reporters Gorsuch looked like “he’s playing dodge ball,” saying the nominee “has bent over backwards to avoid revealing anything.” The confirmation hearing resumes on Wednesday morning and is scheduled to last through Thursday. Grassley has said the committee is likely to vote on Gorsuch’s nomination on April 3. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the full Senate would vote on confirming Gorsuch before lawmakers’ mid-April recess.",1,fakenewsnet,,"Trump's high court pick vows independence, says he is no 'rubber stamp'"

"(This version of the November 3 story officially corrects paragraph 13 to read Chapel Hill, instead of Raleigh. The White House initially misidentified Obama’s location in a transcript of his remarks) By Julia Harte ASHEBORO, N.C. (Reuters) - When Bill McAnulty, an elections board chairman in a mostly white North Carolina county, agreed in July to open a Sunday voting site where black church members could cast ballots after services, the reaction was swift: he was labeled a traitor by his fellow Republicans. “I became a villain, quite frankly,” recalled McAnulty at a state board of elections meeting in September that had been called to resolve disputes over early voting plans. “I got accused of being a traitor and everything else by the Republican Party,” McAnulty said. Following the blowback from Republicans, McAnulty later withdrew his support for the Sunday site. In an interview with Reuters, he said he ultimately ruled against opening the Sunday voting site in Randolph County because he had “made a mistake in reading the wishes of the voters.” He declined to discuss the episode further. This year’s highly charged presidential contest between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump has stoked accusations by both parties of political meddling in the scheduling of early voting hours in North Carolina, a coveted battleground state with a history of tight elections. In emails, state and county Republican officials lobbied members of at least 17 county election boards to keep early-voting sites open for shorter hours on weekends and in evenings – times that usually see disproportionately high turnout by Democratic voters. Reuters obtained the emails through a public records request. The officials also urged county election boards to open fewer sites for residents to cast ballots during early voting that began on Oct. 20 and ends on Saturday. Civil rights advocates and Democrats launched their own campaigns for expanded early voting hours. The tug-of-war yielded mixed results. The state did ultimately add nearly 5,900 more hours and 78 more sites to vote early than in 2012. But several counties opened only one polling site during the first week of early voting, slightly denting turnout across the state. Voter turnout dropped by 20 percent in the counties that had multiple polling sites during the first week of early voting in 2012 but just one site during the first week in 2016. “We currently have more early voting locations and hours open than ever were open under Democrat control,” said North Carolina Republican Party executive director Dallas Woodhouse, denying his party was trying to suppress the Democratic vote. President Barack Obama praised the expanded early voting opportunities during an election stop in North Carolina on Wednesday. “Those who wanted to suppress the vote, they’re going to fail,” he said at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill in Chapel Hill. “Right now, there are more one-stop early vote sites in North Carolina than ever before.” Counties that Obama, a Democrat, won in 2012 increased their Sunday hours this year by 16 percent, while counties that voted for his Republican rival, Mitt Romney, decreased them by nearly a quarter, the records show. State Republican officials say keeping polls open during evenings and weekends, or “off-hour” times, drains county resources. In two emails, on Aug. 11 and Aug. 14, Woodhouse urged Republicans serving on county election boards to follow the “party line” on curtailing the early voting period. “Many of our folks are angry and opposed to Sunday voting,” he wrote. “Six days of voting in one week is enough. Period.” Keeping polling sites open for the full 17-day early voting period “may be wasteful and unnecessary,” he added. Woodhouse’s emails were subsequently published by local media, but he was not alone in lobbying to limit voting hours, the Reuters review of public records shows. The review counted similar emails from at least four other Republican Party officials to election boards, each of which is composed of two Republicans and one Democrat. The same day that Woodhouse sent his Aug. 11 email, Elaine Hewitt, a member of the Rowan County Republican Executive Committee, sent the county elections board two proposed schedules for early voting, both of which included just one site for the first four days and no sites on Sundays. “With all of the opportunities to vote by mail, early in person Monday - Saturday, and on Election Day, there is no justification for requiring election workers to work on Sundays,” she wrote. Garry Terry, the chairman of the Republican Party for North Carolina’s First Congressional District, sent an email on Aug. 13 to elections board members in his region, reminding them to act “in the best interest of the Republican Party” by opposing Sunday voting and restricting early voting to one location. Hewitt and Terry did not respond to requests for comment. Woodhouse defended the actions of the Republican officials, telling Reuters that Republican opposition to Sunday voting was not discriminatory but was rather based on the belief that people should not be required to work on Sundays. The Sunday polling site that McAnulty first supported and then opposed would have been located at the Randolph County Board of Elections office and would have cost around $1,000 to operate, according to the office director. “If it’s not wasteful and it allows more people to vote... the board has historically been for that,” Margaret Megerian, the Democratic member of board, told Reuters. In contrast with the Republicans’ email campaign, the Democratic push to expand early voting hours has largely taken shape in public forums. In Democratic-leaning Guilford County, the state’s third largest, a county board of elections meeting on Aug. 8 attracted about 75 people after word spread that the board was planning to halve the number of early voting sites, from 24 in 2012. The Rev. Nelson Johnson said in an interview that the proposal by the board’s Republican chairwoman would “prevent voting especially by people who can’t easily take time off” and said it “absolutely” had a racial intent. Johnson, who is African American, leads a community center in Greensboro, North Carolina. Board Chairwoman Kathryn Lindley told Reuters she believed “a lesser number of sites would cause less confusion about which places were going to be open,” and that it was “ludicrous” to think her suggested plan had been discriminatory. The board ultimately agreed to 25 early voting sites and one day of Sunday voting before the November election. Johnson said the decision was “a significant triumph.” Lindley said Johnson’s group had no influence on the final outcome. Guilford’s plan also included one restriction that particularly angered Democrats. In the first week of early voting in 2012, residents could vote at 16 sites. This year, that has been reduced to one. Mary Cranford, 52, a registered Republican, was fourth in line on the first day of early voting in Guilford. She was able to vote but said she was upset that only one site was open for the first week. She said she voted for Clinton this year. “I can’t believe what’s been done to keep some people from voting in this state,” she said. Just 7,916 people voted in the first week of early voting in Guilford this year, compared to 60,732 in 2012, according to state elections board records. The general counsel for Clinton’s campaign and other plaintiffs filed a court motion on Oct. 1 demanding Guilford and four other North Carolina counties expand their early voting opportunities. The court denied it, saying that changing the early voting plans “would create logistical difficulties.”",1,fakenewsnet,,Insight: Emails show how Republicans lobbied to limit voting hours in North Carolina

"Are the Palin s above the law in Alaska? Will there ever come a time when America is no longer obsessed by families who have done nothing to earn our fascination with them? The oldest son of former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin was arrested in a domestic violence case in which his girlfriend was afraid he would shoot himself with an AR-15 assault rifle, according to court documents filed Tuesday.Track Palin, 26, is charged with assault, interfering with the report of a domestic violence crime and possessing a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident Monday night at the Wasilla home of his parents, where he lives, according to an affidavit by police.The girlfriend told authorities she was punched in the face by Palin, who is the oldest child of Sarah Palin, the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee and conservative icon.The charges were filed Tuesday, the same day Sarah Palin endorsed Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump before voting begins with the Iowa caucuses.There is no telephone listing for the girlfriend. The court documents say the woman, Track Palin s girlfriend of one year, had bruising and swelling around her left eye, and she said her right knee hurt after Palin kicked her there.Palin family attorney John Tiemessen declined to comment on the matter other than to say in an email that respect for the family s privacy is appreciated as Track receives the help that he and many of our returning veterans need. Palin s arraignment was held Tuesday, but Tiemessen was not sure if he entered a plea yet.According to the three-page affidavit, both Palin and his girlfriend called 911 that night. Police Officer Andrew Kappler wrote that he arrived at the Wasilla home and found Track Palin walking outside and talking on a phone. The officer said Palin had an injury to his right eye and surrounding area, smelled strongly of alcohol and acted with escalating hostility, prompting Kappler to put him in handcuffs.Police say a breath sample provided by Palin showed he had a blood alcohol level of 0.189.The affidavit says other officers found the girlfriend hiding under a bed inside the home and crying.The argument continued at the home, according to the affidavit, which says Palin struck the woman with his fist on the left side of her head near her eye. She curled up in the fetal position because she didn t know what else he would do, the woman told police. She said he then kicked her in the knee and threw her phone across the driveway, according to the court document. The woman said she went inside after getting her phone.Inside, Palin held the rifle, with the barrel just away from his face pointed to the side, the affidavit states. The affidavit adds that the woman told police Palin was yelling Do you think I won t do it? The girlfriend was concerned that he would shoot himself and ran outside and around the house, the affidavit says. She didn t see where Palin went, so she went inside and up the stairs, where she hid under a bed. It s not the first encounter with the law for Palin or other members of his family. In September 2014, he and other Palins were involved in a brawl that broke out at a party in Anchorage.No arrests were made in the melee, and no one wanted to press charges. But according to a police report, Palin had blood around his mouth and his hands. He was belligerent until his mother told him to talk to a police officer.

Hers depicted actual violence. The Onion picture was graphic, yes. It was also bloody, but Hannity (all of them) was depicted as alive and well.Still, Hannity didn t want to miss his ride on the victim train. He likes to play both sides: victim and victimizer. Just. Like. Trump.Now, as you may recall, a few news cycles ago, it was Hannity who was under fire for promoting a false conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton murdered a Democratic National Committee staffer. Hannity is also just fine with Ted Nugent s actual death threats toward Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.It looks like Hannity s career will survive, but the right, as they always do, will attempt to take down anyone who is a convenient distraction. As for The Onion, they re loving the publicity. I never would have seen the picture if it weren t for Hannity telling me about it, and I assume I m not in the minority.Featured image via Kevin Winter/Getty Images.",0,fakenewsnet,, Sean Hannity Is Totally Butthurt Over This Onion Picture

"The Republican Party is having a terrible week when it comes to the perverts in their ranks being outed. First, there s the fact that Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore has been accused of dating girls as young as 14, and actually molesting said 14-year-old. What s worse is the fact that instead of demanding that Moore leave the race, many Alabama Republicans have been defending him. One of them, Alabama GOP Auditor Jim Ziegler, even used the Bible as a justification for Moore s alleged actions.Now, the GOP has another mess on their hands when it comes to perversion in their ranks: Minnesota State Rep. Tony Cornish. The Star Tribune obtained a text message Cornish sent to a fellow lawmaker, in which he joked about how aroused he was while looking at her on the State House Floor. The Star Tribune says of the text message they received: Maye Quade, first elected in 2016, provided the Star Tribune with a text message from Cornish in May 2017 in which he wrote that he got busted for staring at you on the House floor Haha. I told him it was your fault, of course. Look too damned good. Ha. I must be more gentlemanly when I run for governor. As if that were not bad enough, there s Cornish s treatment of a female lobbyist in his office. The lobbyist alleges that Cornish trapped her in the office and insisted that she help him with his, quote, raging boner. City Pages says of that incident: The most disturbing allegations against Cornish come from a lobbyist who asked to have her identity protected. The lobbyist says Cornish engaged in a years-long campaign of harassment, soliciting her for sex in text messages she rebuffed him and once pushing her against a wall in his office and trying to kiss her.On another occasion, during a meeting in his office, the woman says she was attempting to leave when Cornish stood up and pointed down, saying: I have a raging boner. You can t leave. This, the lobbyist says, Cornish said twice; she did leave, anyway.And let s remember for every one of these incidences that gets reported, there s usually bunches more that don t, because of the way people who come forward regarding being sexually harassed and assaulted are treated.Get your act together, GOP. This behavior is not just unacceptable. It s criminal. Oh, and let s not forget you guys are the ones who go around judging and moralizing on the lives of others. So much so, in fact, that many of you make entire careers of doing just that. Family values indeed.Featured image via tonycornish.com",0,fakenewsnet,," Perverted GOP State Rep.

"RAQQA, Syria (Reuters) - U.S.-backed militias in Syria declared victory over Islamic State in its capital Raqqa on Tuesday, raising flags over the last jihadist footholds after a four-month battle. The fighting was over and the alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias was clearing the city s stadium of mines and any remaining militants, said Rojda Felat, commander of the Raqqa campaign for the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). A formal declaration of victory in Raqqa will soon be made, once the city has been cleared of mines and any possible Islamic State sleeper cells, said SDF spokesman Talal Selo. In Washington, the U.S. military said that about 90 percent of Raqqa had been retaken from Islamic State but it expected the SDF to face pockets of resistance. The fall of Raqqa, where Islamic State staged euphoric parades after its string of lightning victories in 2014, is a potent symbol of the jihadist movement s collapsing fortunes. Islamic State has lost much of its territory in Syria and Iraq this year, including its most prized possession, Mosul. In Syria, it has been forced back into a strip of the Euphrates valley and surrounding desert. The SDF, backed by a U.S.-led international alliance, has been fighting since June to take the city which Islamic State used to plan attacks abroad. A Reuters witness said militia fighters celebrated in the streets, chanting slogans from their vehicles. The fighters and commanders clasped their arms round each other, smiling, in a battle-scarred landscape of rubble and ruined buildings around the main square. The flags in the stadium and others waved in the city streets were of the SDF, its strongest militia the Kurdish YPG, and the YPG s female counterpart, the YPJ. Fighters hauled down the black flag of Islamic State, the last still flying over the city, from the National Hospital near the stadium. We do still know there are still IEDs (improvised explosive devices) and booby traps in and amongst the areas that ISIS once held, so the SDF will continue to clear deliberately through areas, said Colonel Ryan Dillon, a spokesman for the coalition. In a sign that the four-month battle for Raqqa had been in its last stages, Dillon said there were no coalition air strikes there on Monday. Speaking with reporters in Washington later on Monday via video conference, Dillon said about 100 Islamic State fighters still remained in Raqqa. We expect our Syrian Democratic Force partners to hit pockets of resistance as the final parts of the city (are) cleared, Dillon added. Fatima Hussein, a 58-year-old woman sitting on a pavement smoking a cigarette, said she had emerged from her house after being trapped for months by the fighting. Islamic State had killed her son for helping civilians leave the city, she said. The fight for Raqqa has shattered much of the city. Houses, apartment blocks and public buildings were flattened by air strikes or holed by shellfire. On Tuesday the international charity Save the Children said many of the 270,000 people who fled the fighting would likely be stuck in aid camps for months or years. Children who fled were haunted by nightmares from the violence they witnessed, including Islamic State beheadings and coalition air strikes, it said. The SDF has said that after the Raqqa battle ends, it would hand over control to a civil council set up by its political allies. It echoes the pattern in other territory the YPG and its allies have taken across northern Syria. The State Department said the United States would help clear rubble and restore basic services in Raqqa. We will assist and take, essentially, the lead in bringing back the water, electricity and all of that, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told a briefing. But eventually the governance of the country of Syria is something that I think all nations remain very interested in. Kurdish influence in the future of the mainly Arab city has been a sensitive issue for some activists from Raqqa and for Turkey. Ankara views the YPG militia as an extension of the PKK that has waged an insurgency on Turkish soil for three decades. The SDF took the National Hospital after fierce fighting overnight and early on Tuesday, said spokesman Mostafa Bali. During these clashes, the National Hospital was liberated and cleared from the Daesh mercenaries, and 22 of these foreign mercenaries were killed there, said Bali, using the Arabic acronym for Islamic State. An SDF field commander who gave his name as Ager Ozalp said three militiamen had been killed on Monday by mines that have become an Islamic State trademark in its urban battles. Another field commander, who gave his name as Abjal al-Syriani, said SDF fighters had found burned weapons and documents in the stadium. The stadium and hospital became the last major positions held by Islamic State after some of its fighters quit, leaving only foreign jihadists to mount a last stand. The SDF has been supported by a U.S.-led international coalition with air strikes and special forces on the ground since it started the battle for Raqqa city in early June. The final SDF assault began on Sunday after a group of Syrian jihadists evacuated the city under a deal with tribal elders, leaving only a hard core of up to 300 fighters to defend the last positions. Raqqa was the first big city Islamic State captured in early 2014, before its series of rapid victories in Iraq and Syria brought millions of people under the rule of its self-declared caliphate, which passed laws and issued passports and money. It used the city as a planning and operations center for its warfare in the Middle East and its string of attacks overseas, and for a time imprisoned Western hostages there before killing them in slickly produced films distributed online. The SDF advance since Sunday also brought it control over the central city public square, where Islamic State once displayed the severed heads of its enemies, and which became one of its last lines of defense as the battle progressed. The offensive has pushed Islamic State from most of northern Syria, while a rival offensive by the Syrian army, backed by Russia, Iran and Shi ite militias, has driven the jihadists from the central desert. On Tuesday, a military media unit run by Lebanon s Hezbollah said the Syrian army, which Hezbollah fights with, had pushed into the last Islamic State districts of Deir al-Zor city. The only populated areas the jihadist group still controls in Syria are the towns and villages downstream of Deir al-Zor city along the Euphrates valley, areas that for the past three years Islamic State ran from Raqqa.",1,fakenewsnet,,Islamic State defeated in its Syrian capital Raqqa
"All hell broke loose on Monday when the city of Charlottesville held their first city council meeting since torch-wielding white supremacists took over the small Virginia town, leaving a counter-protester dead in their wake. Residents were more than ready to let the city council know just how they felt about the city allowing Nazis to march through their streets. You had multiple opportunities to intervene and you did not intervene one time. We told you exactly what you needed to do and you did nothing, one man told the city council members at the meeting.Two protesters who were holding a sign that read Blood on your hands climbed up on top of the dais, at which point several members of the city council got scared and ran away. Police eventually removed several people from the meeting and arrested at least three of them, which prompted the crowd to chant Shame and Shut it down. Vice Mayor Wes Bellamy, was the only official who had the guts to stay and try to negotiate with the protesters, who have every right to be pissed off that Nazis were given a permit to spread their hate and violence throughout Charlottesville. The protesters called for Mayor Mike Signer to resign from his position, chanting Signer must go! After making it abundantly clear that they do not appreciate the city council inviting white supremacists to town, they also demanded the removal of Confederate monuments from Charlottesville. The city agreed to begin the removal process and a motion was approved by the council that will commemorate the victims of the Nazi rally by draping black fabric over the statues.Watch more on the mayhem here, via WVIR: NBC29 WVIR Charlottesville, VA News, Sports and WeatherFeatured image via video screen capture",0,fakenewsnet,, All Hell Breaks Loose At First Charlottesville City Council Meeting Since Nazi Rally

"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia is negotiating with U.S.-based seabed exploration firm Ocean Infinity to resume the search for Malaysia Airlines MH370, which vanished three years ago in the southern Indian Ocean with 239 people aboard. The disappearance of the aircraft en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur ranks among the world s greatest aviation mysteries after Australia, China and Malaysia ended a fruitless A$200-million ($157-million) search effort in January. This week, Malaysia said it had received proposals to continue the search from Ocean Infinity, Dutch firm Fugro and an unidentified Malaysian company. Ocean Infinity beat out the competition and the government has begun negotiations with it, Malaysia s deputy transport minister Aziz Kaprawi said on Thursday. Yes, we are negotiating with Ocean Infinity, but the agreement has not been finalised, he told Reuters, but declined to comment on the potential reward for the plane s discovery. It was an offer on an open basis, that we will only honor if the aircraft is found. The firm had made an offer on a no-cure, no-fee basis, according to a letter, seen by Reuters, that was sent to passengers families on Thursday. Australia and China were informed of the negotiation process, but only Australia had informally agreed to Malaysia s choice, Aziz said. It is still under discussion with China, he added, but declined to elaborate on China s possible concerns. Australian and Chinese authorities did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. Ocean Infinity could not confirm the award of a contract, but good progress has been made , a spokesman said in a statement. Calvin Shim, whose wife was one of the MH370 crew, said he was relieved authorities were considering resuming the search. Grateful this step is finally being officially taken, he told Reuters in a text message. Relatives of others on board voiced concern over the lengthy talks, however. Families were told of Ocean Infinity s offer in March, said Grace Nathan, a lawyer whose mother was aboard. The best weather for the search is spring and summer, said Nathan. We worry they will lose that window if they take too long to decide.",1,fakenewsnet,,Malaysia in talks with U.S. firm Ocean Infinity to resume MH370 search

"PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron vowed to quickly rebuild the islands of the French Caribbean during a visit on Tuesday meant to dispel anger at his government s response to Hurricane Irma, which killed at least 43 people in the region. The clutch of Caribbean islands hardest hit by the storm were mainly overseas territories belonging to Britain, France and the Netherlands, whose tens of thousands of residents are European Union citizens. The U.S. Virgin Islands were also hard hit. European countries and the United States have sent troops to deliver aid and provide security after the storm toppled homes and hospitals, but locals and tourists short of food or shelter say help was slow to arrive. Macron, who is also facing the first test at home of his resolve to reform the economy with a day of protests against his labor reforms, denied that authorities reacted too slowly. Basic services in the region were lost after Irma, weakening law and order, and looting erupted on some islands. Haiti s government said on Tuesday more than 10,000 people were in shelters after heavy rains flooded the former French colony. Britain was forced to reinforce its marines on the British Virgin Islands after more than 100 very serious inmates escaped after a prison was breached in the storm, Alan Duncan, Britain s minister for Europe and the Americas, said on Tuesday. It was not clear if the prisoners had been captured. Macron was due to travel on Tuesday to St. Martin, an island France shares with the Netherlands that suffered some of the worst devastation from Irma. Most of the 10 people killed by Irma lived on French territories there. St. Martin will be reborn, I promise, Macron told reporters in Pointe-a-Pitre, on the French island of Guadeloupe. I will shake up all the rules and procedures so the job is done as quickly as possible. It will be done quickly, it will be done well, and it will be done better. Macron said 50 million euros will be made available as soon as possible, and 2,000 security forces have been deployed, including the army, roughly double the original contingent. The French government has said it would take at least three months for water distribution to normalize. The electricity supply has also been badly hit, authorities said. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson traveled on Tuesday to the Caribbean to visit British territories devastated by Irma. Among the hardest hit islands were the British Virgin Islands, Anguilla, plus Antigua and Barbuda. He is very keen to see for himself the devastation, to reassure governors who have done a magnificent job under quite the most incredible pressure, Duncan said. Four people died on Anguilla, up from one reported previously, Duncan said, while the death toll on the British Virgin Islands rose by one to five. Speaking on CNN, Stacey Plaskett, delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives for the U.S. Virgin Islands, said there was no real looting occurring, but rather desperate people scrambling for scarce supplies. Our airport, the terminal looks as if grenades have been inside there and bombed the places out, she said. This is not anything that we could ve been prepared for.",1,fakenewsnet,,Macron vows Caribbean rebuild as anger rises against European powers
"Caroline Kennedy, daughter of President John F. Kennedy, has left her post as Ambassador to Japan. After being forced out by the incoming Trump Administration (with no replacement) Kennedy is returning back to civilian life in New York.According to the New York Post, Kennedy is eyeing a potential Senate bid in New York for 2018, in which she would face popular incumbent Kirsten Gillibrand and Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney.But the sources from the Post also say Kennedy s eye is going even further, which includes a White House bid in 2020. Should Trump still be in office (and seek a second term), Kennedy would be seen as a liberal alternative to the populist billionaire.According to one source, who is close to the Kennedy family and Caroline Kennedy herself: Caroline had a successful ambassadorial run in Japan and feels really very confident about putting her hat in the ring for a New York congressional or Senate seat, with even possibly bigger political objectives down the road. Another source added: Caroline is seen in some quarters as the next Hillary Clinton. She has the Kennedy name but no Clinton baggage. After serving as Ambassador for three years, Kennedy oversaw an expansion of relations between the U.S. and Japan, which included controversial stances against whaling, and ending nuclear arms expansions.During Kennedy s tenure, her office came under intense scrutiny from the Inspector General s office. The report, which was described as damning, alleges that Kennedy, like Hillary Clinton, used a private email server and mismanaged many aspects of her office. Kennedy has defended her use of private email, as well as her handling of the Ambassador s office.Before becoming a diplomat, Kennedy had been a steadfast advocate for many progressive issues, including her uncle Ted s mission in life universal healthcare. Kennedy also holds progressive views on a variety of social issues, which include supporting abortion rights and LGBT causes. She has called for reauthorizing the assault weapons ban, and says NAFTA needs to be re-examined. One issue that bogged Clinton down in the primary was her initial support for the Iraq War, but Kennedy claims to have opposed it from the beginning.While Kennedy has the money (her net worth lies between $80 million and $500 million), the name recognition, and the support to run, nothing has been set in stone. Everything is speculative.Aside from Senator Cory Booker, Kennedy has become the first rumored potential candidate for the 2020 election season.Featured image via Slaven Vlasic via Getty Images",0,fakenewsnet,, Caroline Kennedy Is Eyeing A White House Bid

"AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Texas Governor Greg Abbott joked about shooting journalists while visiting a gun range on Friday to sign a bill lowering the cost of a handgun license, drawing criticism from gun-safety and free-press advocates who called his remarks “dangerous.” Abbott signed the bill at an indoor gun range in Austin, the state capital, then demonstrated his own shooting skills at an upstairs firing gallery before holding up his bullet-pocked target and quipping, “I’m gonna carry this around in case I see any reporters.” A photo of the moment, published by the Texas Tribune, showed the grinning first-term Republican governor pointing to the center of the paper target, where three rounds had pierced the bull’s eye circle. His comment drew sharp rebukes from Reporters Without Borders, headquartered in Paris, and the Washington-based Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. Both said the incident was especially troubling as it came amid increasingly hostile rhetoric directed against the news media by Republican President Donald Trump and his supporters. “This joke was dangerous and out of line. Because it’s never just a joke to some,” Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence said in a statement. “Words matter. In a state and country where dangerous people can still so easily buy guns without a background check, leaders of every political stripe should be careful not to green light violence on their behalf.” The two groups also cited the misdemeanor assault charge filed on Wednesday against Republican Congressman-elect Greg Gianforte of Montana, accused of body-slamming a reporter who asked him about healthcare on the eve of his election. “Politicians must condemn this dangerous rhetoric against reporters as it can quickly escalate to physical violence like we saw in Montana,” Reporters Without Borders said in a Tweet. The group’s latest annual World Press Freedom Index of 180 countries ranks the United States at No. 43, one rung below the tiny West African nation of Burkino Faso. “We’re really seeing just how much America deserves that ranking right now,” said Margaux Ewen, the organization’s U.S. advocacy director. Abbott’s office did not respond to requests by Reuters for comment. The bill he signed will cut fees for a first-time license to carry a handgun from $140 to $40, and lower the renewal fee from $70 to $40, starting in September. It also waives the fees for peace officers and members of the military. “No law-abiding Texan should be priced out of the ability to exercise their Second Amendment rights,” Abbott said in signing the measure.",1,fakenewsnet,,Texas governor draws criticism for joke about shooting journalists

"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - A man was jailed for 10 years for rape by a Swedish court on Thursday for forcing 27 children from the United States, Canada and Britain to perform sex acts on themselves or with other children that he viewed over the internet. The case, heard in Uppsala, marked the first time in Sweden that a person has been convicted of rape without having met the victim - setting a precedent for such crimes over the internet to be treated as seriously as if they were committed in person. The district court makes a very important assessment here. It states clearly what is required for an act performed by a girl on her own body to be regarded as rape when the perpetrator is not in the same room, prosecutor Annika Wennerstrom told TT news agency. This may lead to a different level of priority and status from the police in criminal investigations with these types of crimes. The 41-year-old Swede found the girls via social media and threatened to rape them and kill their families unless they committed the sex acts on themselves, on other children or with animals. The children, most under the age of 15, either streamed the acts to the man over the internet or recorded them and sent them later. The man was also sentenced for a large number of acts of online sexual abuse of children and child pornography. As a result of this case, Wennerstrom said the means of investigation and the penalties could change. We will be given the opportunity to use other types of methods with this legal classification, penalties will be longer and the chances for compensation for victims will increase, she said.",1,fakenewsnet,,"In court first, Swede jailed for rape of children online"

A spokesman from the family said it might be related to the Baltimore riots.Officer April Pikes remains in critical condition at Houston s Ben Taub Hospital, a public relations official at the Houston Police Department said to Breitbart Texas. Her alleged attacker, Jeremiah M. Matthews, 23, was pulled off of her by a group of men while he was stabbing her and attempting to grab her pistol, according to a statement from HPD obtained by Breitbart Texas.Harris County prosecutors said that Matthews told them he had the intent to attack a police officer and his desire to kill a police officer, according to a Click2Houston.com report. One of the witnesses, Abe Baker, who helped stop the attack said, I saw him on her, just stabbing her. I wasn t really thinking, Baker said. His arm was just up getting ready to stab her and I just grabbed his arm and took him down, and that s when everybody else came over and we all just took him down. The HPD statement revealed that Matthews stabbed her several times before he was tackled and disarmed. The statement says he was attempting to gain control of her duty weapon. After taking down the suspect, the good Samaritans used the officer s handcuffs to detain Matthews until other police officers arrived and arrested him.The Click2Houston report states that Pike may lose her right arm. She was stabbed repeatedly in her right arm and torso.The scene of the attack was a Walmart located in Meyerland (Southwest Houston), where Pikes was working an approved off-duty security job. Pikes was in uniform when she was attacked. He was in an upbeat mood, whistling and he had a fast pace, walking fast, Baker said of the assailant, who was smiling and cheerful right up until the moment he began his surprise attack. He does have a diagnostic history of mental illness in the past. To what degree that played into what happened, we don t know, local community activist Deric Muhammad said, speaking on behalf of the Matthews family. He said it is possible that Matthews was inspired by the riots in Baltimore Monday night.The weapon was described as a hunting knife in a report by Fox26Houston s Kristine Galvan. That was an innocent woman. She had family, loved ones, Abe Baker told Galvan. That s someone s life and everyone s life counts and matters. Baker said he stopped by the Walmart on a late-night errand to pick up some laundry soap, and came to the rescue when he heard Pikes screams. His quick action, and the response of the other men, probably saved her life. I want to offer my condolences to the victim, said Vanessa Johnson, Matthews mother, in the Fox26 video. As a mother this is painful. I wish her a speedy recovery. My heart and prayers are going out to her and their entire family. The HPD statement from Wednesday morning states that Matthews has been charged with Attempted Capital Murder. His case has been assigned to the 182nd State District Court, which is presided over by Judge Jeannine Barr.Via: Breitbart News",0,fakenewsnet,,BREAKING: TEXAS COP STABBED 14 TIMES By Man Who “had a desire to kill a police officer”

"DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Joe Biden urged executives in Davos to use their influence to drive change in countries where lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people face repression, putting gay rights at the heart of this year’s meeting. The issue is on the official agenda for the first time at the World Economic Forum, where political leaders from countries that discriminate against gay people, such as Nigeria and Russia, schmooze business leaders and billionaire investors. Biden told U.S. executives including Nathan Blecharczyk, co-founder of apartment-sharing firm Airbnb, Muhtar Kent, chairman and CEO of The Coca Cola Company, and Anthony Scaramucci, founder of hedge fund SkyBridge Capital, to push for change. “You can change the terms of debate,” he said. “You actually put governments on notice.” He said he and President Barack Obama privately raise the issue of repression of the LGBT community when they meet political leaders. “I have had some run-ins with at least four heads of state already on this,” said Biden. Banging his fist on the table, Biden said there was no national cultural justification to discriminate against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. “People used to be cannibals as part of their culture, people used to do terrible things as part of their culture,” he said. Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, the United States’ largest LGBT civil rights organization, said business leaders should take the opportunity in Davos to confront the leaders of countries with “hateful laws”. Big business has been key to lobbying for change on gay marriage around the world. Some leading companies, including Google, Twitter and eBay, released videos of their employees voicing their support for marriage equality ahead of a country-wide vote on the issue in Ireland. Apple CEO (AAPL.O) Tim Cook came out last year, but according to the U.S.-based Center for Talent Innovation, 41 percent of LGBT people do not feel comfortable disclosing their sexuality at work. A U.S. Supreme Court ruling legalized same-sex marriage nationwide last year but it is still legal in many U.S. states to fire someone based on their sexual orientation.",1,fakenewsnet,,Biden urges U.S. business in Davos to lean on anti-gay states
"What could Dick Cheney, engineer of the wars that will go down in history as criminal at best, possibly do that is worse than lying to the American people about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq in a fraudulent ploy to gain public support for a war we had no exit strategy for? Cheney told CNN Friday that he would be backing Donald Trump just like he would back anyone else who was on the Republican ticket.That s a stark difference of opinion from Cheney s old Oval Office Puppet, George W. Bush or his brother and daddy, all of whom have vowed not to support Trump in the general election and to skip his nomination at the convention this summer in Cleveland. Mittens Romney has also openly stated that he wouldn t support Donald Trump along with House Speaker Paul Ryan and a slew of other high-ranking establishment Republicans.So why is Cheney sticking around while the party goes about the business of trying to hand our nuclear codes to an idiot? Because he s done it already. In 2001, a complete moron walked into the White House, unqualified to order a sandwich, and somehow Dick Cheney gave him a legacy. Sure it s a legacy of poverty and despair; war and death. Financial collapse isn t such a bad way to end an administration, is it?Cheney knows full-well that Donald Trump, if elected, will be looking back at everyone who abandoned him and you can bet your bottom dollar that Dick Cheney will be listed as adviser in some capacity. That s the kind of West Wing we ll be looking at. Whoever will take the job will be the number one contender for almost every position of power. If you re looking for a career in politics that will come to an abrupt end in four years or less, take a spot in the Trump Administration. Not that it will really matter.

"CAIRO (Reuters) - Six months before Egypt s election, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi s supporters are petitioning for him to run, rallying around the former military commander whose popularity critics say has been dimmed by austerity reforms, security problems and a crackdown on dissidents. Four years ago, Sisi won a landslide victory after he led the military ouster of then president Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood, promising stability following Egypt s 2011 Arab Spring uprising. Sisi, 62, has yet to declare if he will run, though he is unlikely to face strong opposition. He says he will follow the people s will, and many in Egypt still see him as key to stability in a country where unrest since 2011 has battered the economy. But some critics say that narrative has been undercut by tough austerity reforms and a currency flotation that has made even the middle-class poorer, and an Islamic insurgency that has extended outside its battleground in the northern Sinai, The So You Can Build It petition campaign launched by a businessman, professors and pro-Sisi independent lawmakers is looking to whip up turnout for Sisi and show he still has the legitimacy of a popular mandate. Less than a month into the campaign, its founders claim they will rally massive support. A host of celebrities have signed up, posing on social media with petition forms that show Egypt s red, white and black flag, and a silhouette of the pyramids. We will find out from the numbers we have collected what the Egyptian people s support looks like ... especially since there are rumors that there s been a decline in popular support, said Mohamed Shaaban, the campaign s co-founder and an independent lawmaker allied with Sisi. Some Sisi opponents say the scale of the campaign shows that Egyptians have few viable opposition candidates to choose from in the election likely to happen around April. All this negatively affects the political climate in Egypt and increases reluctance to run against Sisi, Mohamed Anwar al-Sadat, nephew of a former president who once backed Sisi but is now considering running against him, said last week. It will discourage voters and make them more reluctant to go out and vote in the upcoming elections. Detractors have taken to social media to poke fun at the petition, posting pictures of aliens and U.S. President Donald Trump signing the form. Others have suggested a counter-movement calling instead for Sisi to step down. Under Sisi s presidency, thousands of dissidents have been jailed, the government has shut down independent media and heavily restricted the conducting of opinion polls. There have been no official polls on the upcoming election yet. However, many Egyptians are wary of challenging the status quo after six years of living through a pro-democracy revolt, a military takeover and a prolonged state of emergency that has left people unwilling to protest or looking for stability. Only two people Sadat and Khaled Ali, a lawyer who challenged Sisi over a dispute about two islands in the Red Sea have publicly aired the idea of challenging him and even they say Sisi is likely to win. Last election, Sisi won about 97 percent of the vote on a turnout of 47.5 percent, after voting was extended for a day. This time, his backers want to show his legitimacy not been tarnished by economic and security problems. The issue is not whether Sisi will win the 2018 election; rather, it is about how much interest and buzz can be generated about the process, said H.A. Hellyer, senior non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council. The more public interest, the better - if turnout and interest is minimal, that won t be catastrophic for the authorities, but is certainly not the image they wish to project domestically or internationally, he added. The campaign was inspired by the 2013 Tamaroud , or Rebellion , petition, that Sisi used as a mandate to topple the Muslim Brotherhood, said Shaaban. The Tamaroud movement encouraged millions of Egyptians to take to the streets demanding the overthrow of Mursi. Sisi then led the military ouster of Mursi after those protests. Organisers says they are already seeing results. What started off with only 10 offices has mushroomed into a large-scale operation with 178 offices nationwide, said Shaaban, and close to half a million likes on the campaign s official Facebook page. The numbers are changing by the moment, said parliamentarian Karim Salem, campaign spokesman and co-founder. Organisers say the campaign is run by volunteers and funded by private donations. Egypt s state news agency reported that 14,000 people had signed the petition in the Nile delta province of Al-Beheira. Reuters could not independently confirm these numbers. The petition form lists five reasons why Sisi should seek a second term cleansing the country of terrorism, completing his megaprojects, ending corruption, education, and protecting its leadership. Even some of Sisi s supporters who helped propel him into power, such as former campaign officials Hazim Abdelazim and Nour al-Huda Zaki, have turned against him over his handling of the economy and security. Critics point to a dispute that saw his government hand over two Red Sea islands to Saudi Arabia, touching a nationalistic nerve. Egypt has fought an insurgency waged by an Islamic State affiliate in North Sinai since 2013. Hundreds of members of the security forces have been killed. But the group has begun turning its guns towards the mainland in attacks this year. Sisi has inaugurated mega infrastructure projects he promised would turn around the economy, and the IMF has praised the progress of measures it has backed that are meant to curb deficits and create long term growth. But many Egyptians say they are frustrated with the immediate fallout of reforms. The currency devaluation a year ago has cut the Egyptian pound s value in half though it has stabilised now - and inflation is just off record highs of above 30 percent. In Shaaban s home district in Cairo, middle-class Sayeda Zeinab, where a petition campaign banner with an image of the smiling president hangs above a main square, Essam Moahmed, a baker, expressed discontent over the economy. Now things are even more expensive than under the Brotherhood. But people can t stand against Sisi, he said. Sisi acknowledges the tough economic situation many Egyptians face, saying sacrifices like IMF-backed austerity reforms are needed so we can take our true place.",1,fakenewsnet,,"Egypt election in view, Sisi supporters fire up campaign for mandate"

"WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (Reuters) - Republican leaders in North Carolina on Thursday refused to back down from a law regulating which restrooms can be used by transgender people after the federal government told the state the law violated the U.S. Civil Rights Act. The state’s leading Republican lawmaker, House Speaker Tim Moore, told reporters in Raleigh that North Carolina would not be “bullied” into meeting the U.S. Justice Department’s Monday deadline to change the law. North Carolina is the first U.S. state to pass a law requiring transgender people to use public bathrooms that correspond with the sex on their birth certificate instead of the gender with which they identify. Republican legislators in several other states have proposed similar laws, making transgender rights a hot-button social issue in an election year. The Justice Department’s challenge is similarly unprecedented, though the agency has in the past intervened on behalf of transgender individuals who have alleged discrimination. The Republican National Committee urged state legislators in January to resist federal policies that allow transgender people to use restrooms of their choice at public schools. The Justice Department said in letters to North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory and other state officials on Wednesday that the state had until Monday to decided if it would stop discriminating against transgender state employees. McCrory affirmed his support for the “very common-sense rule” before a group of business leaders on Wednesday night but said he did not know if the state would fight the Justice Department. His office did not respond to questions on Thursday. If McCrory does not stand down from enforcing the law, the Justice Department’s civil rights division could push for a court order. If a federal judge sides with the agency, North Carolina would have to comply or face a reduction in federal funding. On Thursday, Republican Senate leader Phil Berger’s spokeswoman, Amy Auth, said state lawyers were reviewing the letter. Berger on Wednesday said the department’s position represented “a gross overreach.” North Carolina’s Secretary of Public Safety and officials at the University of North Carolina also received similar letters on Wednesday. Margaret Spellings, president of the University of North Carolina system, said her office would respond to the department’s letter by the deadline. “We take this determination seriously and will be conferring with the Governor’s Office, legislative leaders, and counsel about next steps,” she said. Justice Department spokeswoman Dena Iverson would not say whether the department would take legal action against the state. The state law is being challenged in federal court by critics including the American Civil Liberties Union and Lambda Legal, which advocates for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights. “We’ve never before seen a state do something as aggressive as require mandatory discrimination against its own transgender employees,” said Peter Renn, an attorney with Lambda Legal, in a phone interview with Reuters. Jillian Weiss, an attorney who has argued in federal court for transgender rights, said the Justice Department’s action against North Carolina showed the federal government was willing to intervene when states passed laws reducing rights based on gender identity and sexual orientation. Weiss predicts Mississippi, where a law allowing businesses to refuse service to gay people takes effect in July, will be the department’s next target.",1,fakenewsnet,,North Carolina lawmaker dismisses U.S. deadline to change bathroom law

"Iconic liberal news anchor Lawrence O Donnell is clearly not happy and he has every right to be.Yet again, his Lean Forward bosses at MSNBC opted to cut his show so that they could run a live feed of a Donald Trump stump speech. It wasn t news. It wasn t even new. It was just Donald Trump, up at the podium, saying the kind of disgusting things he always says. MSNBC gave over their network for that. MSNBC silenced one of their star anchors for that.Needless to say, viewers were furious. So too was O Donnell.Because the anchor is in many ways the face of his or her program, many of MSNBC s disgruntled fans took out their frustrating on O Donnell. On Twitter, his account was innundated with negative responses. Many couldn t believe they were watching MSNBC hand over free advertising to Trump. Many just wanted to know why O Donnell wasn t on like they had hoped.Rather than toe the network line and give a weak defense of why Trump just had to be given the air time, O Donnell threw the script away and began sympathizing with his fans. MSNBC screwed up. They have repeatedly screwed up during this election. They need to own @cp2austin I tried to make it clear that wasn t my decision.

Joe Adalian April 29, 2016Like other anchors, O Donnell is rightfully fed up with allowing the tail to wag the dog. Rather than report the news, MSNBC has settled on chasing Trump from campaign event to campaign event in the hopes that viewers will tune in. It s given the Republican candidate unprecedented amounts of free air time. He doesn t even have to spend money on advertising because huge networks give it away for free.And instead of trying to rein in the absurd status quo, MSNBC has shown signs that it will only get worse. Already the network tossed one of their fiercest liberal hosts, Melissa Harris-Perry, because they needed more time for Trump live feeds. They ve recently begun hinting that they will be expanding their conservative morning show, Morning Joe, in an effort to entice both Trump and his fans to check out the network. Host Joe Scarborough is a well known Trump fan making the relationship between the Republican candidate and the network even more inexcusable.Did the media create Donald Trump? The answer is complicated. Certainly, Trump s racist and sexist fans were already around, just waiting for a candidate to say all the right things to them. But there can be no question that the media has enabled Trump. Every phone interview. Every campaign rally. Every panel discussion about Trump s viability makes Trump s star rise. There is no such thing as bad publicity, and nobody gets publicity good and bad like Trump.Kudos to O Donnell for taking a stand against this betrayal of integrity.Featured image via screengrab",0,fakenewsnet,, Lawrence O’Donnell Goes Off On MSNBC For (Once Again) Cutting His Show For A Trump Rally Live Feed

"Thank goodness these Muslim women have a friend in socialist, radical Mayor of New York City An NYPD officer pretended to be a Brooklyn College student at the Islamic Society in New York City, and taking the Muslim oath of faith, before befriending Muslim students to infiltrate the community.The woman, who went by the name of Mel, short for Melike, spent four years earning the trust of Islamic students at the college as part of an NYPD operation to spy on Muslims, according to NY s daily weblog Gothamist.The controversial mission was part of the police departments well-documented plan that sees the blanket surveillance of innocent Muslims.The Mayor of New York, Bill deBlasio has openly criticized such surveillance and declared at a Ramadan dinner that Muslim New Yorkers were still fighting for basic human rights. Watch Mayor DeBlasio defend Muslim women with ties to Al Qaeda here: We recently shut down the Demographics Unit at NYPD, which conducted surveillance on Muslim New Yorkers. Because it s unfair to single out people on the sole basis of their religion, he added. The undercover operation led to some important arrests. Four years after Mel had infiltrated the college, two Queens residents, Noelle Velentzas and Asia Siddiqui, were arrested and charged with allegedly planning to build a bomb.The US Justice Department issued a release stating that the women were linked to members of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and the Islamic State.Many of the cases dealt with by the NYPD often involve a form of entrapment that see undercover detectives and FBI informants carrying out manipulative tactics in order to secure evidence that will later lead to arrests.In the case of Velentzas and Siddiqui, four propane gas tanks, as well as instructions for how to turn them into explosive devices, are said to have been found in Siddiqui s home, and according to the criminal complaint, the two women had in-depth conversations with the undercover officer about their violent aspirations.The undercover officer established a friendship with at least one of the women as early as 2013, according to the criminal complaint.The two women are not alleged to have been in the process of planning a specific attack, and according to the criminal complaint, Velentzas repeatedly stated she would not want to harm any regular people, instead targeting police or military personnel.After 9/11, both the NYPD and the FBI revamped their approach to terrorism investigations and began operating under a policy of preventive prosecution.The NYPD began to look for particular indicators of radicalization such as the wearing of traditional Islamic clothing, giving up drinking or smoking, and becoming involved in social activism. In the NYPD s model of measuring threats, which have been criticized, young people were also a key target. The government often acting through informants is actively involved in developing [terrorism plots], persuading and sometimes pressuring the target to participate, and providing the resources to carry it out, according to the 2014 Human Rights Watch report. Brooklyn College students at the Islamic Society told Gothamist they feel skeptical and paranoid. In the back of all our minds, there s always that suspicion, that either, you are a spy, or you think I m one, a female Muslim student stressed.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Legislation helping Puerto Rico dig out of its $70 billion debt crisis is set for a vote in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday after a House panel fended off attempts to open the bill to a series of controversial amendments. By voice vote on Wednesday, the Rules Committee, the gatekeeper for bills moving through the House, sent the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA) to the full House for debate and a likely vote on Thursday. The legislation, the result of months of negotiations between Congress and the Obama administration, would create a federal oversight board to work with investors to determine how much they would recover of the island territory’s $70 billion in loans. Republicans have stressed that no taxpayer money would be used to bail out Puerto Rico from a crisis that has left nearly half of the population in poverty amid closings of schools and hospitals and a contracting economy. During a Rules panel debate that stretched into the night, the committee rejected pleas to allow amendments that would have changed the basic structure of the legislation and the operation of the oversight board. If the bill passes the House, action would move to the Senate, where some leading Democrats have said they would seek significant changes. Earlier on Wednesday, House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Rob Bishop, who ushered the bill through his committee on May 25, told reporters he expected the full House to pass it on Thursday. Bishop, a Utah Republican, said a strong vote for passage in the House would help propel it through the Senate. “The bottom line is the better the vote here (in the House), the less likely it’s going to come back in a significantly altered form” from the Senate, Bishop said. Supporters hope to get it enacted into law before July 1, when Puerto Rico faces a deadline for making a $1.9 billion debt payment that it might not be able to fulfill. The House Rules Committee voted to allow debate on a limited number of amendments, including one giving priority to protecting federal taxpayer investments in Puerto Rico, such as mass transportation assets. Another amendment expected to be debated would expand a federal program aimed at encouraging economic development in Puerto Rico’s “under-utilized” business zones. Representative Raul Grijalva, a senior Democrat who worked on the bill, said Puerto Rico’s debt crisis, if unaddressed, could grow into a humanitarian crisis. Stabilization measures contained in the bill, he said, “would be the first step toward getting the situation under control.” But his fellow Democrat, Puerto Rican-born Representative Luis Gutierrez, warned, “I don’t think many of my colleagues in this body appreciate just how deeply offensive the bill before us is regarded in Puerto Rico.” He was particularly concerned with the way control board members would be chosen, with most not having to have any ties to the island. But Gutierrez failed to convince the committee to allow amendments to be offered making changes to the board and its operations.",1,fakenewsnet,,Puerto Rico debt bill cleared for Thursday U.S. House vote

"It s been more than 18 years, but anyone who was alive at the time will remember when they first heard the news that Eric David Harris, 18, and Dylan Bennet Klebold, 17, two students from Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, had shot and killed 12 of their fellow students, plus one teacher and wounded 21 additional people, before turning their guns on themselves in the school s library on that fateful morning of April 20, 1999. The pair were also packing almost 100 explosives in what USA Today described as a suicidal attack [that was] planned as a grand if badly implemented terrorist bombing. At the time it was almost impossible to conceive a greater tragedy, two lonely teenage outcasts feeling the need to take so many innocent young lives on just a regular day at school. Sure, there had been other mass-shootings of a greater scale, but Columbine is still the worst US high school shooting on record, was the second-worst mass-shooting on any school campus at the time behind the 1966 University of Texas massacre, and the fifth-worst mass-shooting on US soil.Fast-forward less than two decades later and the murder spree at Columbine High School no longer even cracks the top-10 when it comes to the worst single-day mass-shootings in modern US history. What makes the statistics even more terrifying is that the five worst mass-shootings in the United States and six of the top-10, have all occurred in the last 10 years. To make matters worse, three of the top-5 were in the past 18 months.Here are the 10 worst single-day mass-shootings in modern US history, counting victims only. In each instance, the shooter s death has been omitted.Which brings us to Eric Harris, Dylan Klebold, and the Columbine High School massacre. To many, that is one of the worst tragedies the human mind can conjure up Just a couple of misunderstood teenagers who sought the justice of who they saw as their transgressors by running riot on their school and shooting at anyone in their path, resulting in 13 deaths, before killing themselves. This incident is no longer one of the 10 worst mass-shootings in modern US history, but something needs to be done before it drops any lower.Featured image via screenshot",0,fakenewsnet,, Sunday’s Massacre In Texas Bumped Columbine Out Of The Top Ten Deadliest US Mass Shootings

"So in an effort to reach out to Muslims living in America, we need to invite groups that are tied to terrorists? Why stop at groups like CAIR? Why not invite ISIS? Perhaps we missed it, but we haven t seen the list of prominent Christian leaders invited to Obama s SOTU, who will represent the worldwide mass persecution of Christians As many as 25 House Democrats are expected to have Muslim guests during Tuesday night s State of the Union speech. It s in response to a call from Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison, the first Muslim voted into Congress, to counter an alarming rise in hateful rhetoric against Muslim Americans and people of the Islamic faith worldwide. The gesture might not generate much more than a shrug, except that in at least two cases, Democrats invited officials from a group the FBI formally avoids due to historic ties to a Hamas support network.Delray Beach Rep. Alcee Hastings invited Nezar Hamze, regional operations director for the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) in Florida. And San Jose, Cal. Rep. Zoe Lofgren invited Sameena Usman, a 10-year veteran government relations official with CAIR s San Francisco chapter, the Investigative Project on Terrorism has learned.CAIR officials routinely accuse federal law enforcement of entrapping otherwise innocent and peaceful Muslims in order to gin up terrorism prosecutions. Hamze s colleagues in CAIR-Florida are helping a family sue the FBI over the 2013 fatal shooting of a terror suspect who attacked agents after extensive questioning. Usman s office published a notorious poster urging Muslims to Build a Wall of Resistance [and] Don t Talk to the FBI. For its part, the FBI cut off contact with CAIR, except in investigations, in 2008 based on evidence its agents uncovered which placed CAIR in a Hamas-support network in the United States. Until it can be shown that those connections no longer exist, an FBI official explained in 2009, CAIR is not an appropriate liaison partner. In addition, several CAIR officials have compared Israel to ISIS.Calls to press contacts in Lofgren and Hastings offices were not returned Monday.Last month, the IPT provided exclusive details from eyewitness accounts about CAIR s creation, including an account of how a co-founder sought approval from the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood for CAIR s bylaws, and how Executive Director Nihad Awad s move to Washington was in order to represent Hamas. Hastings and Lofgren either failed to check out their guests employer or they don t care. These connections have nothing to do with the faith of CAIR officials. But the organization has a record that elected officials stubbornly insist should be ignored. Unfortunately, this is part of a pattern of outreach House Democrats seek out with the wrong people. Last month, CAIR-Florida s Hassan Shibly was invited to the White House for a discussion about religious discrimination. Then, as with the State of the Union speech, no one from the new Muslim Reform Movement which issued a declaration clearly rejecting interpretations of Islam that call for any violence, social injustice and politicized Islam and standing for peace, human rights and secular governance.

"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish police fired tear gas to disperse protesters outside a courthouse in Ankara on Thursday at the start of the trial of two teachers who have been on hunger strike since losing their jobs in a crackdown following last year s failed coup. Literature professor Nuriye Gulmen and primary school teacher Semih Ozakca have been surviving on liquids and supplements for six months, and doctors have described their condition as dangerously weak. They were detained in May over alleged links to the militant leftist DHKP-C group, deemed a terrorist organization by Turkey, and the court on Thursday ruled that they be remanded in custody until the next session in two weeks. Neither they nor their original lawyers were in court. The gendarmerie said the defendants might try to escape from the courtroom, despite their weakened state, and arrest warrants were issued this week for 18 of their lawyers. Police attempted to break up the protests using tear gas, and riot police were present inside and outside the building. At least 20 protesters were detained, being dragged along the ground in the process. The first obstacle before a fair trial was the detention of their lawyers, which also served as a veiled intimidation attempt at the judges trying them. Now they are not brought to court, in an open breach of their right to defend, said Baris Yarkadas, a lawmaker from the main opposition Republican People s Party (CHP). At least a hundred lawyers were present at the courthouse to defend the teachers, along with CHP parliamentarians and the pro-Kurdish opposition Peoples Democratic Party (HDP). The court refused the applications of 1,030 lawyers who wanted to represent the teachers, saying it would limit the defense s representation to three lawyers for the duration of the trial. The trial s second hearing will be held in Ankara on Sept. 28. The teachers have said their hunger strike aimed to draw attention to the plight of roughly 150,000 people suspended or sacked since last July s failed coup, which President Tayyip Erdogan blames on followers of U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen. Gulen denies any involvement. Last month, the European Court of Human Rights rejected a request by the two teachers to order Ankara to release them on health grounds. Since the failed coup attempt, some 50,000 people including journalists, opposition figures, civil servants and others have been detained in the crackdown. Rights groups and Turkey s Western allies accuse the government of using the coup as a pretext to muzzle dissent. Ankara says the purges are necessary due to the gravity of the threats it faces.",1,fakenewsnet,,Turkish police fire tear gas at protesters outside hunger strikers' trial

"BEIRUT (Reuters) - U.S.-backed militias said they captured Syria s largest oil field on Sunday, pressing their assault against Islamic State in the east of the country. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said they took al-Omar field on the eastern bank of the Euphrates river in the early hours. Our forces managed to liberate the fields without notable damages, said Lilwa al-Abdallah, spokeswoman for the offensive in Deir al-Zor province. The jihadists holed up in buildings in a nearby district, where the SDF was trying to hunt them down, she said. With U.S.-led jets and special forces, the SDF has been battling in Deir al-Zor bordering Iraq. The alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias has focused on territory east of the river, which bisects the oil-rich province. The Syrian army, with Russian air power and Iran-backed militias, has been waging its own separate offensive against Islamic State, mostly to the west of the river. The U.S.-led coalition and the Russian military have been holding deconfliction meetings - to prevent clashes between planes and troops - though the two offensives have sometimes come into conflict. Islamic State has lost vast territory across Syria, and has now come under attack in its last footholds in a strip of the Euphrates valley and the desert in Deir al-Zor. The SDF declared victory over the jihadists in their former headquarters in Raqqa city this week. SDF fighters would now move to the frontlines in Deir al-Zor, speeding up the battle in eastern Syria. Last month, the Kurdish-led militias captured a major natural gas field upstream of Sunday s advance. Al-Omar oil field lies some 10 km (6.21 miles) north of the town of al-Mayadin, which government troops and their allies took earlier this month. The town had turned into a major base for Islamic State militants after the U.S.-backed offensive drove them out of Raqqa. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Islamic State fighters who had withdrawn from the oil field mounted a counter-attack overnight against government forces. The militants made some gains around al-Mayadin, the Britain-based monitor said. But a Syrian military source denied this, saying there was no significant attack and fighting raged on at the same pace. Any attack by the Islamic State militants there was a desperate attempt , the source said. The Syrian Arab Army is attacking, hitting Daesh positions...and advancing, the source said, using the Arabic acronym for Islamic State.",1,fakenewsnet,,U.S.-backed militias seize key oil field in east Syria: SDF

"Hillary Clinton appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live on Monday night and absolutely killed it.Jimmy Kimmel has spent a lot of time on his show mocking Donald Trump, so it was only natural for him to talk to the Democratic nominee about him.The first segment of the interview was dedicated entirely to discussing the imploding Republican nominee.Right after Hillary sat down Kimmel remarked that the crowd was cheering quite enthusiastically for the co-founder of ISIS, which drew laughter from the former Secretary of State, who replied that the claim was one of the crazier things that Trump has said during his campaign.And with all the ridiculous things Trump has said on the campaign trail, Kimmel asked if she gets upset. I don t get upset anymore, Clinton said, because I d be upset all the time. Hillary pointed out that Trump s rhetoric is music to the terrorists ears because they would love to influence our elections in any way they can. It also gives them advertising material to use to draw new recruits.Considering Trump s unpredictability and insanity throughout his run for the presidency, Kimmel wondered how Hillary is preparing to debate him, which drew a very interesting and hilarious response. I watched a lot of his debates during the primaries and he insulted all of his opponents, he insulted all the moderators, he insulted, I guess about 80 percent of the American people and the rest of the world You gotta be prepared for all the wacky stuff that comes at you. I am drawing on my experience in elementary school. Kimmel also asked Hillary about her health and the claims of Trump and his team that she is unfit to serve because she is not well. Hillary compared Trump s attack to a tabloid story, remarking that the National Enquirer once said she would be dead in six months, but that was a long time ago and she s still full of life. I don t know why they are saying this, Clinton said. I think on the one hand, it s part of the wacky strategy. Just say all these crazy things and maybe you can get some people to believe you. On the other hand, it just absolutely makes no sense. I don t go around questioning Donald Trump s health. Kimmel then challenged her to open a pickle jar to prove her fitness, and she opened it.Hillary then admitted that she had hoped to be running against someone more serious and qualified to do the job of President of the United States. I would prefer to be running against somebody who I thought was qualified to be president and temperamentally fit to be commander-in-chief I don t think we ve ever been confronted with somebody who we see right now in the midst of this election is unqualified and temperamentally unfit. Hillary went on to name three Republicans who have endorsed her and praised their decision to put country first.And at the end of the interview, she read some mean quotes uttered by Donald Trump. But she refused to read the one of Trump saying he would date his own daughter.This was an excellent interview for Hillary Clinton. She dispelled the rampant falsehoods being pushed by Trump and his minions while at the same time showing the American people that she is a positive person who is qualified for the office she seeks.

As expected, he completely blew it and humiliated America once again.Earlier that day, German leader Angela Merkel had spoken at NATO HQ, where she took a shot at Trump when she said it wasn t the building of walls that makes us successful. Merkel and Trump already have a rocky relationship, as America s unworthy POTUS has publicly disrespected Merkel several times. Trump had responded by criticizing NATO for not putting enough money toward defense, but apparently he didn t get it all out of his system. While in Brussels, Trump continued to lash out at Merkel with his usual childish behavior and went off on a disgusting rant against the Germans.German publication Der Spiegel reported that as Trump spoke to EU Commissioner Jean-Claude Juncker and European Council President Donald Tusk, Trump further damaged America s standing with Germany by saying this: The Germans are bad, very bad. Trump also promised to put an end to German car sales in the United States: Look at the millions of cars they sell in the US, and we ll stop that. Junker tried to explain to incompetent Trump that free trade was beneficial, and EU attendees expressed concern that Trump actually had no idea how EU trade agreements actually worked, and that America couldn t isolate Germany in negotiations.Overall, Trump s statements about Germany were extremely embarrassing and a pathetic response driven by Trump s fragile ego. It couldn t be more clear that Trump has no idea what he s doing as POTUS, and has even less awareness about how America s relations with other parts of the world really work.

"The fracking industry has given the state of Oklahoma a new claim to fame that no one in Oklahoma wanted. In 2015, Oklahoma had more earthquakes than the entire continental United States combined. There were 857 earthquakes in Oklahoma with a magnitude of 3.0 or higher. The total number of earthquakes for the continental United States with a 3.0 magnitude or higher was 1,556.Nearly two dozen peer reviewed, scientific papers have been published that show that there is a likely link between waste water injection wells used by the fracking industry and the increased number of quakes that have rocked the state.Oklahoma has seen a dramatic increase in the number of earthquakes over the past few years, that coincide with the state s fracking boom. In 2014, there were 585 quakes, a record for the state. In 2013, there were a comparatively stable 106.Here is a chart that shows the rising number of earthquakes. It is important to note that there were 84 less quakes in 2015 than was projected. As devastating as the quakes can be for the local population, they are also a matter of national security. The small town of Cushing, Oklahoma is considered a top target for terrorist attacks. That s because Cushing is the largest oil hub in North America. Cushing holds a considerable amount of crude oil. Bloomberg reports that some of the tanks can fit a Boeing 747 jet inside of them. Though they are generally used to store around 10 million barrels of crude oil. On Oct. 10, 2015 a 4.5 earthquake occurred just three mules from Cushing.The irony that a process used to extract oil is putting the United States largest oil hub in grave danger, should not be lost on anyone.In 2015, the ban on oil exports was lifted, setting the stage for increased use of fracking in the United States, far more so than what was already expected to occur.Featured Image Credit: Oklahoma Office Of The Secretary Of Energy & Environment via Ecowatch",0,fakenewsnet,, Here’s What The Fracking Industry Gave To Oklahoma In 2015 (IMAGES)

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Members of Congress on Thursday grilled the main U.S. banking regulator about a recent raft of data breaches, highlighting two incidents where workers downloaded more than 10,000 sensitive and private records onto portable storage devices before leaving the agency’s employ. After the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp uncovered those two breaches, it conducted a review and found five other instances when employees improperly stored and took personal information for tens of thousands of individuals, according to Representative Barry Loudermilk, a Republican who chairs a House of Representatives subcommittee on oversight and technology. Altogether, more than 160,000 people were affected, Loudermilk said at a hearing covering the breaches. “To date, FDIC has failed to notify any of those individuals that their private information may have been compromised,” he added. The highest-ranking Democrat on the subcommittee, Representative Don Beyer, said the concerns were shared by members of both parties and added the FDIC was too slow in notifying Congress about the breaks in data security. It should have informed lawmakers within seven days of the incidents, he said. The FDIC’s chief information officer and chief privacy officer, Lawrence Gross, told the hearing the agency is working to eliminate employees’ use of portable media and has installed technology blocking most employees from downloading data from its systems to DVDs, CDs and flash drives. It is also looking into “digital rights management” software limiting the time period someone can access information and putting up other barriers to redistributing information. Gross, who started his role in November, said he is conducting a “top to bottom review” of the agency’s information technology policies and planned to hire an independent third party to conduct an assessment. The FDIC has said the downloads were inadvertent. But members of Congress remained skeptical that the breaches were not intentional. “In at least one case...a former employee who downloaded such data was evasive about her actions and not cooperative when initially confronted,” said Representative Bill Johnson. “Some FDIC employees also suggest that it was highly improbable that this former employee’s actions were accidental. In addition this former employee is now working for a U.S. subsidiary of a non-U.S. financial services company which raises additional concerns.”",1,fakenewsnet,,Congress subcommittee grills U.S. banks regulator about data breaches

"Always eager to use a tragedy to erode the Constitution, immediately after the terror attack in Brussels, Republican Senator Tom Cotton renewed calls to pick out the safe refugees and let them come to America. What makes them safe? Why, they ll be Christians, of course! I think the U.S. has a moral imperative to try and save these Christians and the other small minority groups, he said. So I would create a special kind of visa program that wouldn t take any access away from anyone else in the United States, but would recognize that Christians like Jews in the Soviet Union are being singled out for persecution and elimination. That s in our interest, as it is in combating the Islamic State. That is, of course, total bullshit. ISIS has been slaughtering Muslims by the thousands for not being extreme enough. Sure, they re killing every OTHER religion they find, but the majority of their violence is reserved for their fellow Muslims.Curiously, Cotton seems to be lacking any and all empathy for them. Almost like he doesn t consider Muslims to be people. That s really the only way to talk about moral imperatives while ignoring the bulk of the victims of religious violence.That must be why he was one of the numerous Republicans that demanded all Syrian refugees be turned away from the United States including children that were accused of being tiny terrorists. Where was his moral imperative then?Of course, once this proposal fails, Cotton will hold it up as proof that Christianity is under attack in America. Don t you see? The only POSSIBLE reason for not granting special privileges to Christians must be that liberals are trying to wipe out Christians! There s no way the Constitutional and (actual) moral prohibition against treating any one religion as superior (or inferior) could be involved.I wish I could say that this is an isolated incident but the two leading candidates for the Republican nomination, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, were just as repulsive in the wake of the attack. One insulted the stricken city of Brussels and the other attacked Islam and Obama. Very classy.By comparison, Tom Cotton almost seems like a human being instead of a callous monster.Featured image via AI archives.",0,fakenewsnet,, After Brussels Terror Attack Republican Senator Renews Call For Religious Tests For Refugees

"Ever since Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia s death. Republicans have been clear about one thing: No matter what, they intend to obstruct Obama because every day is a day that ends in -day. While the president has a Constitutional duty to appoint a new Justice to replace the much-reviled racist, anti-gay, anti-woman sleazebag now that he is burning in Hell, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has vowed that he won t allow the Senate to even consider Obama s nominee no hearings, no votes, nothing.Republicans falsely claim that it is outside tradition for a president to appoint a new Supreme Court Justice in his final year in office, despite that a full third of presidents have done so in an election year. On Tuesday, the president met with McConnell and Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley in the Oval Office to talk about Obama s plan to nominate someone within the next couple weeks. Unfortunately, the Republicans refused to budge on their mission to obstruct the president.The meeting barely lasted forty minute and, while the president offered to consider anyone McConnell and pals suggested for the position, they continued their usual modus operandi of not having a single f*cking idea.After the pointless meeting, President Obama took to social media to smack down some elephants. On Facebook, he brilliantly trolled the pro-Constitution party with 36 words that should (but won t) shut them up namely, Article II Section 2 of the Constitution. The message was punctuated with the hashtag #DoYourJob a message Obama has been sending Republicans since they initially announced that they would obstruct him no matter what. On Twitter, the president posted a petition urging the Senate to do its job. Our Supreme Court is too important to be held hostage by the same partisan gridlock that has caused government shutdowns, the petition reads. President Obama is taking his constitutional responsibility seriously the Senate should do the same. Along with the petition, Obama left a very clear message: Leaving a seat open on the Supreme Court for more than a year is irresponsible. Along with the petition, Obama left a very clear message: Leaving a seat open on the Supreme Court for more than a year is irresponsible but what else can we expect from Republicans these days?

"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Slovenia would be a good place for a first meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, Russia’s Vladimir Putin said on Friday, but he said the choice of venue would not be Moscow’s alone. Putin made the comments after Slovenian President Borut Pahor offered Ljubljana, his country’s capital, as a venue for a meeting between the Russian and U.S. leaders who have not met since Trump’s inauguration last month. Trump and Putin have both said they would like to try to mend battered U.S.-Russia ties, which fell to their lowest level since the Cold War after Russia’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea. Putin made it clear that no date for such a meeting had yet been agreed, but said he was keen to try to restore Russian-U.S. relations in full. “As regards Ljubljana, Slovenia in general, it is of course a brilliant place to have a dialogue of such a sort. But it doesn’t depend only on us, it depends on a whole series of circumstances,” Putin told reporters after meeting Pahor in Moscow. “If these meetings ever happen, we don’t have anything against Ljubljana,” Putin said. European Union member state Slovenia was the venue for the first meeting between George W. Bush and Putin in 2001 where the then American leader made what became a famous comment about looking Putin in the eye and getting “a sense of his soul.” It is also where Melania Trump, the U.S. president’s wife, grew up.

"President Trump just called on GOP Senators to continue working through recess on repealing and replacing Obamacare:Trump calls on GOP Senators to continue working through August recess on repealing Obamacare: Frankly, I don t think we should leave town pic.twitter.com/wf8PWRqn8c BuzzFeed News July 19, 2017It s a full court press from Trump! He thought the votes were there to pass this yesterday and has said he is very disappointed in the failure of the Senate to pass this Obamacare repeal and replace:In an impromptu White House presser during President Trump s lunch with Vice President Pence, Trump drove home how disappointed he is about health care: Let Obamacare fail, it will be a lot easier. And I think we re probably in that position where we ll just let Obamacare fail. We re not going to own it. I m not going to own it. I can tell you the Republicans are not going to own it. We ll let Obamacare fail and then the Democrats are going to come to us. Why it matters: Trump is acknowledging defeat and now, rather than support Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell s push to repeal with out a replacement bill, he s decided to let Barack Obama s Affordable Care Act remain the law of the land. fast forward and McConnell s straight repeal plan collapses with 3 no votes. The three no votes came from three women who should really be in the D column: By Tuesday afternoon, three Republican senators all women had come out against Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell s plan to push a vote on a clean Obamacare repeal bill enough to sink it altogether. Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) confirmed they would not vote for a repeal bill that delayed enacting the policy by two years.Susan Collins needs to go!President Trump also said he was surprised when Senators Moran and Lee came out as No s last night.

"Days after testifying in front of Congress and after requesting more resources for the Russian investigation, FBI Director James Comey was fired on Tuesday night, effective immediately.The Trump administration is blaming Comey s handling of the Hillary Clinton emails, which makes no sense whatsoever because Trump loved Comey s handling of the emails in October. Trump tried to make the case that he fired Comey for being mean to Hillary Clinton, but even the most rabid Trump supporters have to acknowledge that his Lock Her Up, slogan is completely incompatible with Trump s given rationale.It doesn t take a tin foil conspiracy theorist to imagine that the real reason for the Comey firing is that he was getting too close to the truth in investigating Trump s Russia connections. NPR imagines even more scenarios, like the fact that Comey was becoming too big and was stepping on poor little Donnie s ego. It s becoming more and more likely though, that there were just two reasons Comey was fired and both of them should scare the hell out of you.According to two sources that CNN is calling close to Comey, the two reasons Comey was fired were:#2 confirms everything we ve been assuming since the news broke Tuesday night. #1, though, while not at all surprising, is almost more frightening. Trump had to have approached Comey at some point, demanding his loyalty. That s third-rate Banana Republic dictator crap. It makes one wonder just how many people have had to make an oath of loyalty, not to the Constitution, but to Trump. Maybe it s just the people who might have damaging goods on the administration or maybe it s every single person in his administration, which could explain why hundreds of jobs still remain unfilled within the Executive Branch.Loyalty oaths or no loyalty oaths, the Trump administration s charade when it comes to the handling is quickly coming unraveled.

"(This story from November 16 corrects paragraph 15 to say Aden port only partially open and Sanaa airport remains closed, not open for commercial flights) By Stephanie Nebehay and Tom Miles GENEVA (Reuters) - The heads of three U.N. agencies urged the Saudi-led military coalition on Thursday to lift its blockade of Yemen, warning that untold thousands would die if it stayed in place. The coalition closed all air, land and sea access to Yemen on Nov. 6 following the interception of a missile fired towards the Saudi capital, saying it had to stem the flow of arms from Iran to its Houthi opponents in the war in Yemen. Yemen already has 7 million people on the brink of famine, but without the reopening of all ports that number could grow by 3.2 million, the heads of the World Food Programme, UNICEF and the World Health Organization said in a joint statement. The cost of this blockade is being measured in the number of lives that are lost, the statement from David Beasley, Anthony Lake and Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. Together, we issue another urgent appeal for the coalition to permit entry of lifesaving supplies to Yemen in response to what is now the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres wrote to Saudi U.N. Ambassador Abdallah Al-Mouallimi to warn him that the blockade was already reversing the impact of humanitarian efforts, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said on Thursday. The Secretary-General is very much disappointed we ve not seen a lifting of the blockade. The Secretary-General and his humanitarian team are heartbroken at the scenes we re seeing from Yemen, Dujarric told reporters. Saudi Arabia has since said that aid can go through liberated ports but not Houthi-controlled Hodeidah, the conduit for the vast bulk of imports into Yemen. For months, the U.N. has warned that the closure of Hodeidah would dramatically escalate the crisis. As of Wednesday, 29 vessels, with 300,000 tonnes of food and 192,000 tonnes of fuel, had been blocked, while U.N. ships carrying $10 million of health and nutrition supplies and 25,000 tonnes of wheat were waiting to berth at Hodeidah, according to another U.N. statement. Without fuel, the vaccine cold chain, water supply systems and waste water treatment plants will stop functioning. And without food and safe water, the threat of famine grows by the day, the U.N. agency heads said. At least one million children are at risk if a fast-spreading diphtheria outbreak is not stopped in its tracks, and the lives of 400,000 pregnant women and their babies are under threat because of the lack of medicines. There is also the risk of a renewed flare-up in cholera, which was on the wane after the most explosive outbreak ever recorded - with over 900,000 cases and 2,200 deaths in the past six months. The number of new cholera cases has declined for the last eight weeks, Sherin Varkey, UNICEF deputy representative in Yemen, said in a telephone interview from Sanaa on Thursday. The government-controlled port of Aden has partially re-opened for limited shipments of aid, while Sanaa airport remains closed for commercial and humanitarian flights. Humanitarian access is inadequate as needs are so huge , he said. There is a fuel crisis. Some estimates say fuel will only last in the country for 20 days because of the blockade and challenges of getting fuel into the country, Varkey said. UNICEF is helping provide clean water to 6 million Yemenis by ensuring fuel is delivered to water pumping stations in cities, he said. Our worry is with the fuel shortage this could affect and even we assume reverse the declining trend (in cholera), he said.",1,fakenewsnet,,U.N. pleads for end of Yemen blockade or 'untold thousands' will die

"(Reuters) - Since President Donald Trump’s election, monthly lectures on social justice at the 600-seat Gothic chapel of New York’s Union Theological Seminary have been filled to capacity with crowds three times what they usually draw. In January, the 181-year-old Upper Manhattan graduate school, whose architecture evokes London’s Westminster Abbey, turned away about 1,000 people from a lecture on mass incarceration. In the nine years that Reverend Serene Jones has served as its president, she has never seen such crowds. MORE FROM REUTERS More Democrats oppose Trump's Supreme Court pick After healthcare flop, White House looks to Congress for help on tax reform Obamacare exploding? Maybe just a slow burn “The election of Trump has been a clarion call to progressives in the Protestant and Catholic churches in America to move out of a place of primarily professing progressive policies to really taking action,” she said. Although not as powerful as the religious right, which has been credited with helping elect Republican presidents and boasts well-known leaders such as Christian Broadcasting Network founder Pat Robertson, the “religious left” is now slowly coming together as a force in U.S. politics. This disparate group, traditionally seen as lacking clout, has been propelled into political activism by Trump’s policies on immigration, healthcare and social welfare, according to clergy members, activists and academics. A key test will be how well it will be able to translate its mobilization into votes in the 2018 midterm congressional elections. “It’s one of the dirty little secrets of American politics that there has been a religious left all along and it just hasn’t done a good job of organizing,” said J. Patrick Hornbeck II, chairman of the theology department at Fordham University, a Jesuit school in New York. “It has taken a crisis, or perceived crisis, like Trump’s election to cause folks on the religious left to really own their religion in the public square,” Hornbeck said. Religious progressive activism has been part of American history. Religious leaders and their followers played key roles in campaigns to abolish slavery, promote civil rights and end the Vietnam War, among others. The latest upwelling of left-leaning religious activism has accompanied the dawn of the Trump presidency. Some in the religious left are inspired by Pope Francis, the Roman Catholic leader who has been an outspoken critic of anti-immigrant policies and a champion of helping the needy. Although support for the religious left is difficult to measure, leaders point to several examples, such as a surge of congregations offering to provide sanctuary to immigrants seeking asylum, churches urging Republicans to reconsider repealing the Obamacare health law and calls to preserve federal spending on foreign aid. The number of churches volunteering to offer sanctuary to asylum seekers doubled to 800 in 45 of the 50 U.S. states after the election, said the Elkhart, Indiana-based Church World Service, a coalition of Christian denominations which helps refugees settle in the United States - and the number of new churches offering help has grown so quickly that the group has lost count. “The religious community, the religious left is getting out, hitting the streets, taking action, raising their voices,” said Reverend Noel Anderson, its national grassroots coordinator. In one well-publicized case, a Quaker church in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on March 14 took in a Honduran woman who has been living illegally in the United States for 25 years and feared she would be targeted for deportation. Leaders of Faith in Public Life, a progressive policy group, were astounded when 300 clergy members turned out at a January rally at the U.S. Senate attempting to block confirmation of Trump’s attorney general nominee, Jeff Sessions, because of his history of controversial statements on race. “I’ve never seen hundreds of clergy turning up like that to oppose a Cabinet nominee,” said Reverend Jennifer Butler, the group’s chief executive. The group on Wednesday convened a Capitol Hill rally of hundreds of pastors from as far away as Ohio, North Carolina and Texas to urge Congress to ensure that no people lose their health insurance as a result of a vote to repeal Obamacare. Financial support is also picking up. Donations to the Christian activist group Sojourners have picked up by 30 percent since Trump’s election, the group said. But some observers were skeptical that the religious left could equal the religious right politically any time soon. “It really took decades of activism for the religious right to become the force that it is today,” said Peter Ubertaccio, chairman of the political science department at Stonehill College, a Catholic school outside Boston. But the power potential of the “religious left” is not negligible. The “Moral Mondays” movement, launched in 2013 by the North Carolina NAACP’s Reverend William Barber, is credited with contributing to last year’s election defeat of Republican Governor Pat McCrory by Democrat Roy Cooper. The new political climate is also spurring new alliances, with churches, synagogues and mosques speaking out against the recent spike in bias incidents, including threats against mosques and Jewish community centers.

"(Reuters) - Highlights of the day for U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration on Thursday: Trump is poised to impose new sanctions on multiple Iranian entities, seeking to ratchet up pressure on Tehran while crafting a broader strategy to counter what he sees as its destabilizing behavior, people familiar with the matter say. The White House says Trump is “extremely upset” with an agreement with Australia to accept refugees but will honor it. The White House says Israel’s building of new settlements or expansion of existing ones in occupied territories may not be helpful to achieving peace with Palestinians. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley blames Russia for the recent surge of violence in eastern Ukraine and warns Ukraine-related sanctions against Russia will not be lifted until Moscow returns Crimea to Kiev. Trump’s Treasury Department adjusts sanctions on the Russian intelligence agency FSB, making limited exceptions to measures put in place by the Obama administration over accusations Moscow meddled in the U.S. presidential election. Trump vows to free churches and other tax-exempt institutions of a 1954 U.S. law banning political activity, drawing fire from critics who accuse him of rewarding his evangelical Christian supporters and turning houses of worship into political machines. Trump defends his order to temporarily bar entry to people from seven majority-Muslim nations, saying it is crucial to ensure religious freedom and tolerance in America; he discusses establishing safe zones in Syria with Jordan’s King Abdullah. A Department of Homeland Security watchdog agency says it is planning to review how Trump’s executive order to temporarily suspend travel from seven majority-Muslim nations was implemented. Nobel Peace Prize winners meeting in Colombia criticize Trump’s immigration policies and accuse him of xenophobia and discrimination.

"BERLIN (Reuters) - Senior members of German Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives on Saturday rejected the vision for a United States of Europe put forward by the Social Democrats (SPD), with whom they are hoping to form a governing coalition. SPD leader Martin Schulz said on Thursday his party, which suffered its worst post-war election result in September, would only gain support by providing a clear vision of Europe, and called for a United States of Europe by 2025. Merkel s conservatives, who lost voters to the far-right due to their liberal migrant policy, want the SPD to agree to a last-ditch alliance with them after talks on a tie-up with two smaller parties collapsed. Discussions on maintaining the conservative-SPD coalition, which has governed Germany since 2013, are due to start on Wednesday but the two parties look set to clash over the issue of Europe, which is likely to play a key role in talks. Senior conservative Volker Kauder said Schulz s European proposal posed a danger to the EU and citizens approval of Europe and Peter Altmaier, Merkel s chancellery chief, said the idea, and especially the timeframe, was unrealistic. An Emnid poll for Bild newspaper found less than a third of Germans (30 percent) supported Schulz s idea while almost half (48 percent) rejected it. Kauder told the Tagesspiegel newspaper it was necessary to strengthen Europe but also important to recognize that at the moment people longed for the reliability that they believe they can find in national states . He added: The proposal would also jeopardize the work of unification that is unique in the history of the world because the majority of member states certainly wouldn t participate in creating a united states. Altmaier told the Rheinische Post newspaper that Schulz s proposal had surprised him and it would be better to tackle specific problems in Europe such as unemployment, the protection of external borders and coordination of economic policy. The discussion about whether Europe should be a federal state, confederation or a united states is one for academics and journalists - not for German foreign policy, Altmaier said. A United States of Europe would transfer member states sovereignty to Brussels and there would not be a majority for that in many EU states, he added. Merkel has also been skeptical, saying on Thursday she would rather concentrate on more cooperation in defense by 2025, on employment and on innovation. The Christian Social Union (CSU) - the Bavarian sister party to Merkel s Christian Democrats (CDU) - also rejected Schulz s plan. Senior CSU member Markus Soeder told Welt am Sonntag his party did not want Germany becoming an administrative unit of the European Commission in a European superstate . But the SPD defended Schulz s plan, with Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel telling Deutschlandfunk radio it would ensure Europe s voice is heard on the global stage at a time when the influence of Asia, Latin America and Africa is growing. The SPD is stressing that the outcome of talks with the conservatives is still open but Schulz said on Saturday if the SPD had the chance to prevent old-age poverty, improve nursing care and affordable housing, it needed to take that opportunity. Other options are a Merkel-led minority government or new elections. The SPD has not ruled out either possibility, and newly elected SPD General Secretary Lars Klingbeil told Bild newspaper he would immediately start preparing for a possible election campaign. The SPD had initially planned to revamp itself in opposition after its poor election showing but agreed to talk to the conservatives when other coalition talks collapsed. An Emnid poll showed 61 percent of Germans thought joining another grand coalition would weaken the SPD further. Kauder said the conservatives would go into talks prepared to make compromises but added his party had some absolutely key demands like capping migration and suspending the right to family reunions for some asylum seekers.",1,fakenewsnet,,German conservatives reject 'United States of Europe' ahead of coalition talks
"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey issued detention warrants for the lawyers of two hunger-striking teachers on Tuesday, days before they are due to appear in court, lawyers representing the academics said. Nuriye Gulmen, a literature professor, and Semih Ozakca, a primary school teacher, have been on hunger strike for more than six months after they lost their jobs in a crackdown following a failed coup against President Tayyip Erdogan. Doctors say they have been surviving on liquids and supplements, but have described their condition as dangerously weak for several months. Authorities detained them in May saying they had links to the militant leftist DHKP-C group, deemed a terrorist organization by Turkey. The warrants were issued for 18 lawyers, all members of two law offices defending the teachers. The detention of our colleagues today is an attempt in vain to leave Gulmen and Ozakca defenseless, a lawyer representing the pair told Reuters, adding that more than 2,000 lawyers had applied to defend them due to the case s symbolic importance. Police raided lawyers offices in Istanbul and Ankara and detained 10 lawyers, while the search for eight others continued. On Thursday, Gulmen and Ozakca will appear in court for the first time since their arrest. So far, 150,000 state employees including civil servants, academics and security personnel have been fired since last year s coup attempt, which Erdogan blamed on followers of U.S.-based Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen. Gulen denies any involvement. Critics accuse the government of using the coup as a pretext to purge dissident voices from public institutions. Last month, the European Court of Human Rights rejected a request by the two teachers to order Ankara to release them on health grounds.",1,fakenewsnet,,Turkey detains lawyers of hunger-striking teachers ahead of trial
"VIENNA (Reuters) - Iran has remained within the main limits on its nuclear activity set by its 2015 deal with six world powers, the U.N. atomic watchdog said in its first report since U.S. President Donald Trump decertified Iranian compliance with the terms. Iran undertook to curb its uranium enrichment program in return for relief from international sanctions that crippled its economy, and U.N. nuclear inspectors have repeatedly verified Tehran s adherence to the key aspects of the accord. Trump has called the agreement between Iran, the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China and the European Union the worst deal ever and he disavowed Iran s compliance last month. His decision did not constitute a U.S. exit from the accord but raised concern about its staying power. Trump s move, at odds with the commitment of the other parties to the deal, meant the U.S. Congress must decide by mid-December whether to reimpose economic sanctions lifted under the accord, reached under his predecessor Barack Obama. If Congress reimposes the sanctions, the United States would in effect be in violation of the deal and it would likely fall apart. If lawmakers do nothing, the deal remains in place. In response, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said Tehran will stick to the nuclear accord as long as the other signatories respected it, but would shred the deal if Washington pulled out. If the deal unravels, it would strengthen hardline opponents of Hassan Rouhani, Iran s pragmatist president who opened up diplomatic channels to Western powers to enable nuclear diplomacy after years of worsening confrontation. Iran s stock of low-enriched uranium as of Nov. 5 was 96.7 kg (213.2 pounds), well below a 202.8-kg limit set by the deal, and the level of enrichment did not exceed a maximum 3.67 percent cap, said the confidential International Atomic Energy Agency report sent to IAEA member states and seen by Reuters. Iran s stock of so-called heavy water, a moderator used in a type of reactor that can produce plutonium, a potential nuclear bomb fuel, stood at 114.4 metric tonnes, below a 130-tonne limit agreed by the parties to the deal. The 3.67 percent enrichment and 202-kg stockpile limit on uranium, and the 130-tonne cap on heavy water, aim to ensure that Iran does not amass enough material of sufficient fissile purity to produce a nuclear bomb. Such a device requires uranium to be refined to around 90 percent purity. IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano told Reuters in September he would welcome clarification from the powers on how the agency should monitor Iran s implementation of the so-called Section T of the nuclear pact that deals with certain technologies that could be used to develop an atom bomb. Russia had been critical of the agency s monitoring of Section T provisions, but Monday s report said the IAEA had verified Iran s commitment to the section.",1,fakenewsnet,,Iran sticks to key limits of nuclear deal: U.N. watchdog report

"FALLS CHURCH, Va. (Reuters) - U.S. Muslim leaders hope to register a million voters from within their community to help combat what they say is the anti-Muslim stance of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. The United States has only about 3.3 million Muslims, but campaign organizers say Muslim voters could have an outsize impact in swing states that are key to the November general election, such as Virginia and Florida. “We want the Muslim community to understand that if you give up your rights voluntarily, no one will come and give it back to you,” said Osama Abu Irshaid, a member of the board of the U.S. Council of Muslim Organizations, which is spearheading the drive. Imams have been asked to encourage their congregations to register to vote. Organizers have sent canvassers to college campuses, bus stations and gas stations in Muslim neighborhoods. The campaign began in December and is part of an effort among U.S. Muslims to combat an “unprecedented rise in Islamophobia,” said Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). CAIR’s database showed that 300,000 Muslims had registered since November, he said. Awad said anti-Muslim sentiment had grown since the mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, last year that authorities have said was inspired by Islamist militants, and due to comments by Trump. He has called for a ban on Muslim immigrants. Campaign volunteers were outside the Dar al-Hijrah mosque in suburban Washington this month to get worshippers to register. “I was thinking quite a long time to register but this time especially ... I really believed that I have to,” said Sadat Najmi as he filled out a registration form. Najmi, a U.S. citizen since 1988, said Trump had motivated him to sign up for the first time. U.S. Muslim backers of Trump said they were trying to build their own coalitions in swing states. Baltimore businessman Sajid Tarar said he launched American Muslims for Trump because he favored Trump’s stance on combating radical Islam. “ISIS (an acronym for the Islamic State), al Qaeda, Taliban, they have killed more Muslims than anything else, and that’s a message Muslims need to hear and understand,” he said, referring to various militant groups. Michael Cohen, co-chair of the National Diversity Coalition for Trump, which aims to mobilize minority support, said Muslim Americans were equally worried about violence at home and abroad. Trump is “the only candidate who will enhance our national security, bring jobs back to America and fix our ailing economy,” he said in an email.",1,fakenewsnet,,Campaign aims to register a million U.S. Muslims voters in anti-Trump move

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump’s transition team on Monday pushed back against an effort to recount Nov. 8’s presidential election votes, calling the effort “nonsense,” but offering no evidence to back a weekend Trump tweet alleging millions of illegal votes. With the clock winding down for voters and candidates to seek recounts in states across the country, Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein requested a recount in Pennsylvania on Monday just hours before the state’s deadline. Filing in Pennsylvania three days after she filed a similar request in Wisconsin, Stein’s campaign said she would file a similar request in Michigan by its deadline on Wednesday. Following Trump’s stunning victory in the presidential contest, talk of recounts has swirled, with the Republican president-elect adding a surprise twist to the discussion. On Sunday, Trump tweeted that “serious voter fraud” occurred in California, New Hampshire, and Virginia, states won by his opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton. All three states rejected Trump’s claim. The White House said on Monday there has been no evidence of widespread election fraud in the presidential contest. Still, Wisconsin officials on Monday prepared to launch a recount of the state’s more than 25 million votes, following Stein’s request last week, a move that was joined by Clinton’s lawyers. “If nothing else, this will give us a very good audit,” Mark Thomsen, the chair of the Wisconsin Elections Commission, said on Monday. “It’s going to reassure Wisconsin voters that we have a fair system, that we’re not counting illegal votes.” A statement on the Wisconsin Elections Commission’s website said the recount was scheduled to begin on Thursday and had to be completed by Dec. 13. Stein’s campaign has raised the money needed to pay filing fees for recount requests in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. But she still aims to raise $800,000 more to cover fees for attorneys and other personnel needed to oversee the recount, said an official with her campaign. The official said any funds left over would be disbursed according to Federal Elections Commission guidelines. California voters still could request recounts there. But the deadline for requesting a recount in New Hampshire has already passed and the margin of victory in Virginia was larger than what is necessary for a recount to occur, according to election officials in those states. New Hampshire’s deputy secretary of state, David Scanlan, said there was no evidence supporting Trump’s claims of widespread voter fraud. “Voter fraud does occur, but it occurs in isolated instances,” he said. California Secretary of State Alex Padilla called Trump’s allegations unsubstantiated and Virginia Commissioner of Elections Edgardo Cortes said they were unfounded.",1,fakenewsnet,,Vote recount effort races forward despite Trump team rejection

"When people think of rape, they generally imagine some masked man grabbing a woman and dragging her into a dark alley or the woods and assaulting her. However, it generally doesn t happen that way. Most sexual assault occurs at the hands of someone the victim knows this is usually referred to as date rape, or acquaintance rape. That is what makes these cases so difficult to prosecute. That is also what makes things like the processing of rape kits and other physical evidence following an assault so vital. However, one Idaho sheriff has gotten the idea in his head that most rapes are consensual sex, and thanks to that, he doesn t think his state needs laws making sure rape kits get processed.However, following rightful public outrage, Bingham County Sheriff Craig Rowland is backpeddling. He took to the Sheriff Department s Facebook page to try to explain just why he made the outrageous and despicable assertion that most rapes are actually, to use his words, consensual sex. Here is this neanderthal s Facebook apology : I want to explain what I was trying to say in the interview. I misspoke when I said the majority of our rape cases are consensual sex. The meaning behind my statement that has been misunderstood is that when a case is called into the dispatch center each and every one is thoroughly investigated. A Deputy is sent to every one of these cases and that Deputy then in turn contacts the on-call detective to help with the investigation. In some of these cases through the investigation it may be determined that the sex was consensual, but not always. In these types of cases after the investigation is complete and it was determined that the sex was consensual. I don t believe that those kits should be sent to the lab. Then, as if that sorry excuse for an apology weren t enough, Rowland then went on to go down the old I m sorry if you were offended road, and then proceeded to paint HIMSELF as a victim here, talking about cyber-bullying : I know that it is hard for victims to come forward on sexual assault cases. I spoke to a rape victim today and told her that I knew it was hard for her to come forward. I want to apologize to anyone who I might have offended with my statement as my main responsibility is to the public s safety and well being and maintaining their trust., he wrote. I can also say with regret that I now know what it is like to be cyber bullied. Not only have I been threatened but so has my family. I hope that this will clear things up a bit. Sure, it clears things up, Sheriff Rowland, but not in the way you think. What you ve said here is no different from what you said before. You re victim-blaming. Nine times out of ten, if a woman says she was raped, she was. You say yourself that it s hard for victims to disclose. So, why the hell would anyone make something like that up? It s men like you, Sheriff Rowland, who keep rape culture alive and well.You have no business in law enforcement, and I sincerely feel for the rape victims for whom you are their only source of so-called help.

"Donald Trump supporters have taken it upon themselves to try and throw Texas senator Ted Cruz out of the presidential race by filing a lawsuit against him.The lawsuit, which was filed on February 3rd at a district court in Alabama, questions if Cruz is even eligible to run for president, considering that he was born in Canada. The lawsuit cites Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution, which states that no person except a natural born citizen, or a citizen of the United States, at the time of the adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the office of president. The plaintiffs of the lawsuit are Sebastian Green, Shannon Duncan, Kathryn Spears, Kyle Spears and Jerry Parker, all residents of Cullman County as well as loyal fans of The Donald. In the suit, the plaintiffs declared that Rafael Edward Cruz is ineligible to qualify/run/seek and be elected to the Office of the President of the United States of America. Thomas Drake, the attorney representing the group, explained: Mr. Cruz was born in Canada, and obviously Canada is not a territory or protectorate of the United States, it s not dominion of the United States. And as such, when he was born, at the moment of his birth, location determined his status, and his status was that of a natural-born Canadian citizen. You cannot be a natural-born or native-born citizen of two countries.

"Donald Trump turned a tragedy into an opportunity to do some heavy fear mongering after news broke that a truck had driven into a Christmas market in Berlin, Germany, killing 12 and injuring dozens.As expected, Trump s response was highly inappropriate and reckless, as he jumped to conclusions and blamed ISIS and other Islamist terrorists before any concrete facts about the incident had been reported.Here s what Trump said: Our hearts and prayers are with the loved ones of the victims of today s horrifying terror attack in Berlin. Innocent civilians were murdered in the streets as they prepared to celebrate the Christmas holiday. ISIS and other Islamist terrorists continually slaughter Christians in their communities and places of worship as part of their global jihad. These terrorists and their regional and worldwide networks must be eradicated from the face of the earth, a mission we will carry out with all freedom-loving partners. Likely another effort by Trump to distract the nation from Russia s involvement in the election, Trump jumped at the opportunity to refresh his anti-Muslim rhetoric and remind everyone why he wants to ban Muslims. There was zero hard evidence to support how Trump reacted, and we can expect much more of this carelessness in January, when he takes office.In contrast, Germany s interior minister gave a much more measured, cautious response: There is a psychological effect in the whole country of the choice of words here, and we want to be very, very cautious and operate close to the actual investigation results, not with speculation. Those are words that Trump could certainly learn from. Whether or not ISIS sympathizers were actually behind the Berlin attack is irrelevant to Trump, as he is trigger happy and quick to point blame, even if he doesn t have the evidence to back it up. This raises massive concerns, and Trump has approximately one month before he begins his role as Commander in Chief. If he doesn t start practicing some restraint, this country is going to be in big trouble.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",0,fakenewsnet,, Trump Responds To Berlin Truck Attack With DANGEROUSLY Reckless Anti-Muslim Comment

"ALEPPO, Syria/BEIRUT (Reuters) - The Syrian army pressed an offensive in Aleppo on Friday with ground fighting and air strikes in an operation to retake all of the city’s rebel-held east that would bring victory in the civil war closer for President Bashar al-Assad. “The advance is going according to plan and is sometimes faster than expected,” a Syrian military source told Reuters. The Syrian army and its allies had recaptured 32 of east Aleppo’s 40 neighborhoods, about 85 percent of the area, he said. Reuters journalists, rebels and a monitor confirmed the military thrust. There were no reports the Syrian army had made significant gains. Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the Syrian army had suspended military activity to let civilians leave rebel-held areas, RIA news agency reported. The army and its allies tried to advance on two fronts, a Turkish-based official with the Jabha Shamiya rebel group said. “Helicopters, warplanes and rocket bombardment like every day. Nothing has changed,” the official said. Despite the bombardment, “the guys are steadfast,” the official added. During a tour of Old Aleppo on Friday, which the Syrian army took control of this week, Reuters journalists counted the sound of nine air strikes in about half an hour. Fighting could be heard from other areas nearby. The Russian air force and Iran-backed Shi’ite militias are fighting in Aleppo on the government side. Rebel leaders have given no sign they are about to withdraw as the civilian population is squeezed into an ever-decreasing area. Russian Defense Ministry official Sergei Rudskoi said on Friday up to 10,500 Syrian citizens had fled parts of east Aleppo still controlled by rebels in the last 24 hours. This could not be independently verified. Syrian government and allied forces have in the last two weeks driven rebels from most of their territory in what was once Syria’s most populous city. The rebels have controlled the eastern section since 2012, and Assad said in an interview published on Thursday that retaking Aleppo would change the course of the civil war across the whole country. The Syrian government now appears closer to victory than at any point in the five years since protests against Assad evolved into an armed rebellion. The war has killed more than 300,000 people and made more than half of Syrians homeless. Outside of Aleppo, the Syrian army declared a ceasefire in several areas around Damascus and the northwestern province of Idlib beginning on Friday evening, without saying how long it would last. There was no immediate comment from rebels. But there was no sign of any such truce inside Aleppo. “There are aerial raids on the city’s neighborhoods with highly explosive incendiary bombs, barrel bombs and artillery shelling,” a fighter with the Nour al-Din al-Zinki rebel group on an eastern Aleppo frontline told Reuters. In Old Aleppo, newly recaptured by the government, there was widespread destruction in the UNESCO World Heritage Site, with fire-damaged ancient buildings, structures reduced to rubble and spent ordnance everywhere. At the side of a road sat a woman in her late 20s, veiled, dressed in black, and weeping as she cradled her baby. “My son was born after three months of siege. There were no hospitals, no diapers, no milk,” she said. “My milk is dry from fear and panic.” Dozens of displaced civilians, including children, had gathered in the road with their belongings after fleeing the Saliheen district, where battles continued. Maher Tashtash, aged nine, said the bombardment had been frightening and rebels had told them they faced death if caught by the army. His brother Mohammed, 12, said they had hidden in a cellar until the fighting passed. Even the dead were not spared the carnage. In the Dar al-Islam cemetery near Ibn Sina street in al-Hamdaniya, graves were destroyed. People were burying corpses in open public ground. The United Nations estimates about 100,000 people are now squeezed into an “ever shrinking” rebel-held pocket of Aleppo with virtually no access to food, water or medical care. In rebel-held Aleppo, a Reuters journalist said there were intense clashes on Friday in Sheikh Saeed district in the south of the eastern sector, where the Observatory and a Syrian military source said government forces advanced on Thursday. Fighting also took place northeast of Aleppo, where Turkey has intervened to support rebels against both Islamic State fighters and Kurdish groups. Turkish-backed rebels closed in on the Islamic State-held city of al-Bab with Turkish tanks and warplanes supporting the assault, Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said. Moscow and Washington have discussed a ceasefire to let civilians escape eastern Aleppo and aid enter. Russia also wants the United States to urge rebel fighters to abandon their territory and accept transport out. U.N. envoy to Syria Staffan de Mistura told the Security Council on Thursday there were signs fighters in Aleppo may want to leave and the council should help them go, diplomats said. The Syrian government said on Friday it was ready to resume dialogue with the opposition, without external intervention or preconditions. Rebels said no such contacts were taking place. “There are no negotiations now, except what’s being discussed internationally,” said Zakaria Malahifji, head of the political office of the Aleppo-based Fastaqim rebel group, speaking from Turkey. “We have asked for the evacuation of civilians who want to leave and of the injured. The fighters are determined to stay and face things.” U.S. and Russian officials will meet in Geneva on Saturday to discuss Aleppo, State Department spokesman Mark Toner said in a news briefing on Friday. The talks will focus on achieving a pause in the fighting, the delivery of humanitarian aid to civilians, and ensuring a safe departure for those who want to leave, Toner said. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, who has invested months of intensive diplomacy on Syria, acknowledged the exasperation many feel. “I know people are tired of these meetings. I’m tired of these meetings. ... what am I supposed to do? Go home and have a nice weekend in Massachusetts while people are dying?” Kerry said at the U.S. embassy in Paris, according to a State Department transcript. “What is happening in Aleppo is the worst catastrophe – what’s happening in Syria is the worst catastrophe since World War Two itself. It’s unacceptable. It’s horrible.” The U.N. General Assembly voted 122 to 13 on Friday to demand an immediate cessation of hostilities in Syria, humanitarian aid access throughout the country and an end to all sieges, including in Aleppo. General Assembly resolutions are non-binding but can carry political weight. The European Union said on Friday it would introduce more sanctions on Syrian individuals and entities over the Aleppo offensive. The U.N. human rights office said hundreds of men from eastern Aleppo were missing after leaving rebel-held areas, voicing deep concern over their fate at the hands of government forces. The government has dismissed reports of mass arrests, torture and extrajudicial killings by its forces as fabrications. Rebels for their part deny they have prevented civilians from leaving opposition-controlled areas.",1,fakenewsnet,,Syrian government forces press attack in east Aleppo
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, casting doubt on the nation’s economic health, said on Tuesday the U.S. economy is in a bubble he fears will burst and he does not want to deal with a financial collapse if he is elected to the White House. The billionaire real estate mogul cited the economy as one of the toughest assignments he would face as president if he wins the Nov. 8 presidential election, along with the Iran nuclear deal. “It’s a very daunting task, and we’re in deep trouble. The country’s a mess,” Trump told ABC’s “Good Morning America” program. “We’re in a bubble,” added Trump, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination. “And, frankly, if there’s going to be a bubble popping, I hope they pop before I become president because I don’t want to inherit all this stuff. I’d rather it be the day before rather than the day after, I will tell you that.” Recent U.S. job growth has been strong and the latest government data showed that the nation’s unemployment rate held steady last month at a 7-1/2-year low of 5 percent even as more people entered the labor force, a sign of confidence in the job market. The U.S. economy is growing at about a 2 percent annual pace, but the manufacturing and industrial sectors have shown weakness. Slumping oil prices and slowing growth in China have cast a pall on the outlook for the global economy. World markets have slumped amid worries over China’s debt. “Look at the stock market today, look at it for the last week,” Trump said. “ ... We’ve gone down so much.” In November, Trump accused the U.S. Federal Reserve of keeping interest rates low to help Democratic President Barack Obama, saying higher rates would burst the U.S. economic bubble. Obama took office in January 2009 amid the biggest U.S. financial crisis in decades, leading to bank and auto industry bailouts and a multibillion-dollar economic stimulus package.

"BEIJING (Reuters) - With lavish pageantry and an uncharacteristic personal flourish, Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday rolled out a red carpet welcome for U.S President Donald Trump at the Forbidden City, the ancient home of China’s emperors. While North Korea and trade are set to dominate the formal part of the visit, which ends on Friday, China has been keen to show the importance it puts on Trump’s visit, the first by a foreign leader since the end of a key Communist Party congress last month where Xi cemented his power. Trump and his wife Melania were whisked from Beijing airport - where they were met by China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi, a key player in the outreach to Trump since he won election a year ago - straight to the Forbidden City. Chatting over cups of tea, Trump showed Xi a video of his granddaughter Arabella Kushner singing in Mandarin and reciting classical Chinese poetry, prompting Xi to compliment her performance as worthy of an “A+”, Chinese state media said. Xi said he hoped Arabella would visit China soon, noting that she was already a “child star” in China, the official Xinhua news agency said. A video of Arabella reciting a Chinese poem went viral on Chinese social media shortly after Trump’s election last year. In another break from precedent, Xi himself gave the Trumps a tour of the imperial treasures of the Forbidden City, a UNESCO World Heritage site cleared of tourists for the day, before the two first couples watched Chinese opera and an acrobatic display. “That’s something!” Trump said after the show, as he and Xi walked away. “We’re having a great time.” China had widely been expected to pull out all the stops for Trump, who has pressed it to do more to control its neighbor North Korea, and resolve a yawning trade gap with the United States. The ceremony on Trump’s arrival at Beijing’s airport on Wednesday was also more elaborate than usual, with the Trumps met by a marching band and soldiers standing at attention. Smartly dressed children waving miniature Chinese and American flags jumped up and down as Trump’s motorcade passed. In another rare, if not unprecedented step, Trump’s official ceremonial welcome at the Great Hall of the People on Thursday will be broadcast live on national television, state broadcaster CCTV said. While the sprawling palace complex in the center of Beijing is a regular stop for visiting dignitaries, it is rare for a Chinese leader to provide a personal escort, confirmation of the “state visit-plus” treatment that China had promised for Trump.",1,fakenewsnet,,China's Xi fetes Trump on first day of Beijing trip

Plague is endemic in Madagascar, but the outbreak that has caused 1,192 suspected cases since August is especially worrying because it started earlier in the season than usual and has hit urban rather than rural areas. In addition, two thirds of the cases are of the pneumonic plague, the deadliest form of the disease. The total number of cases (1,192) is already three times higher than the average annual total, the National Office for Risk and Disaster Management said in a report on Wednesday. Last week a World Health Organization report said the death toll stood at 94. The capital Antananarivo and Toamasina, the two largest cities in Madagascar, an island in the Indian Ocean, were the most affected, with 55 percent of cases recorded there. To date 54 medical staff have been infected, it said.

"It s amazing the sheep mentality of students attending a school that should be promoting individual thought and encouraging students to not buy into propaganda without first exploring the facts.The price of carbon dioxide emissions could be the next thing to drive up the cost of a university education, as Ivy Leaguers at Yale plan to set precedent by becoming the first school in the U.S. to enact a campus-wide carbon charge after signing a pledge at the White House earlier this week.More than 200 universities attended a White House climate change summit Thursday to sign a pledge on taking steps to transition to a low-carbon economy and reduce the effects of global warming. Many scientists blame greenhouse gas emissions, primarily carbon dioxide, for raising the Earth s temperature, causing more severe weather, droughts and coastal flooding.President Obama has been enlisting academic institutions and businesses to reduce their carbon emissions in the runup to a major United Nations climate conference in Paris Nov. 30. Obama intends to agree to a deal there that would commit the U.S. to reducing its emissions 26-28 percent by 2030.Thursday s pledge reads: Today our school pledges to accelerate the transition to low-carbon energy while enhancing sustainable and resilient practices across our campuses. Although it does not obligate campuses to enact so-called carbon charges, Yale University has chosen to begin testing out the idea this year.On Friday, Yale said the pledge renews the university s commitment to maintaining a leadership role on climate change. It notes that in 2005, the university established itself as a global leader for climate change action with an aggressive target of reducing greenhouse gases by 43 percent by 2020. And to that end, it announced a series of practices that includes the launch of a campus-wide, internal carbon charge experiment. Based on a report issued earlier this year by Yale, the charge appears to be derived from an economic model the White House has developed called the social cost of carbon metric. Republicans have criticized the administration s use of the metric in creating costly regulations to reduce emissions, saying the White House has not been transparent in the creation of the metric. In September 2014, Yale convened the Presidential Carbon Charge Task Force to consider whether it would be feasible and effective to institute a university-wide carbon charge, the university said. Based on the task force s recommendation, and consistent with Yale s policy of leading by example on sustainability, Yale will soon announce a campus-wide plan for testing internal carbon charge mechanisms. The task force said Yale would implement a pilot project on carbon pricing. The task force s report said the charge on carbon dioxide emissions would provide incentives for decision makers to reduce reliance on carbon-intensive activities.

IMMIGRANT MUSLIM GROUP Ran Huge Food Stamp Fraud RingIs this connected to the Investor visa program? It makes you wonder if they have training programs abroad in how to buy convenience stores in the US and rip off the dumb (infidel) Americans!More than a dozen retail store operators in and around Baltimore have been charged in connection to a huge food stamp and wire fraud scheme.The indictments allege the retailers received more than $16 million in federal payments for transactions in which they did not provide any food, a fraud scheme commonly known as food stamp trafficking. Retailers must apply to and be approved by the USDA s Food and Nutrition Service to participate in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as the Food Stamp Program, which helps low income families afford nutritious foods.In Maryland, the program provides eligible individuals with an electronic benefit transfer (EBT) card, which operates like a debit card. Authorized retailers use a terminal that checks the card information and deducts the cash value of the purchase from the SNAP balance.SNAP reimbursements are paid to retailers through electronic funds transfers. Retailers bill the government in return for providing approved food items to customers.The indictments allege that the defendants illegally exchanged EBT benefits for cash, instead. To avoid detection, they debited the funds from the card in multiple transactions over a period of hours or days, or called a different store where the transaction was processed manually, the Department of Justice says.As a result these transactions, they allegedly obtained more than $16,482,270 in EBT deposits for transactions in which food sales never occurred or were substantially inflated and split the proceeds with food stamp recipients. The food stamp program is intended to put food on the tables of needy recipients, not to put money in the pockets of greedy criminals, said U.S. Attorney Rod J. Rosenstein. Honest storeowners work hard to earn a profit by actually selling food, and food producers and distributors also benefit. People who play by the rules deserve to know that criminals who defraud them will be held accountable. The defendants face a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison for each count of wire fraud; a maximum of five years in prison for conspiracy to commit food stamp fraud and wire fraud; and a maximum of five years in prison for food stamp fraud.The defendants and their stores are:Walayat Khan, 36, of Reisterstown Barbara Ann Duke, 50, of Owings Mills Maria s Market Place, 307 S.

"In an open letter to President Obama, legendary guitarist Carlos Santana praised the State of the Union Address and Obama s leadership before taking a significant shot at Donald Trump.Santana posted the letter on Facebook, but it has since been removed, perhaps due to so much hateful criticism from conservative fans of the music icon.He begins by telling President Obama how inspired he was by his speech the night before and thanked him being a true leader who strives to heal and unite the world. Santana then turned his thoughts to Donald Trump by telling the story of how the billionaire Republican presidential wannabe reminds him of a poop-throwing ape he once saw at the San Diego Zoo when he was a child. Santana concluded by urging leaders to strive for peace instead of what Trump and other Republicans stand for.Here is the full letter via Clutch Magazine.Dearest Mr. President Obama,I witnessed your speech last night. I am deeply inspired, encouraged and profoundly grateful for your words. Your consciousness soars with clarity and divine purpose. Your articulated your views, subjects and comments with compassion. You made me feel how blessed we are to share life with your leadership. Even more than any other President I have witnessed (including JFK). Your words of spirit and global healing, unity and harmony for the betterment of the world .not just the USA. I pray for your continued safety for you and your family. Regarding Mr. Trump .I remember when I was a child living in Tijuana I often crossed the border to visit the San Diego Zoo. I would hear loud screams and commotion in the distance. As I came closer to the sound, I noticed everyone was staring at an ape in a glass cage. The ape was staring back at the crowd that gathered. With an angry look of disgust, the ape defecated in his hand and threw it at the crowd. This is what I hear when Mr Trump speaks. He lacks consciousness as well as integrity. The Republicans and Mr Trump are selling hate and fear. That is the opposite of what our Country stands for. Let s go forward with light and love into the future. Global Peace is within our grasp in this lifetime. Pull humanity up, take the high road and look at the aerial view. Peace on Earth now, not later.With deep respect and admiration, Carlos SantanaThis is an epic letter by Santana, who hails from Mexico and is a member of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. He must have been truly moved by what President Obama had to say and it must have felt especially good to smack down Donald Trump after listening to him offend the Mexican people over and over again since he announced his campaign for the presidency.If the Hispanic community shares Santana s feelings about Trump, the GOP could be in for a world of hurt on Election Day.Featured Image: Wikimedia",0,fakenewsnet,," Carlos Santana Praises President Obama, Says Trump Is Something He Saw At A Zoo Once"

"In an article aptly titled, Why some Republicans are feeling shame, The Washington Post s Sean Sullivan describes a party sinking into despair at the ridiculous spectacle of Donald Trump bickering with Ted Cruz:[Carlos] Gimenez is watching with disgust, as are many Republicans across the country, as his party s presidential race turns into a tabloid talk show. After a winter that featured anatomical insults, violent clashes at rallies, and fierce accusations of lying and dirty tricks, Republicans say the past week has been particularly dispiriting.Under normal circumstances, I would be cringing right along with them. In decades past, any presidential candidate that acted with such reckless disregard for civility would be shamed out of the public square. Even Karl Rove, the scummiest political operative in Washington D.C., always did his smears from a distance by using proxies that could not be directly linked to the Republican candidate.Those days are long gone as the two frontrunners really are just one thrown chair and a paternity test away from turning the Republican primaries into a full-blown Jerry Springer episode:The luridness has weighed not only on Republican elected officials but on voters as well. In a recent CBS News-New York Times poll, 60 percent of Republican primary voters said the campaign has made them mostly embarrassed for the party rather than mostly proud. The survey was conducted before the Cruz-Trump fight involving their spouses erupted.I imagine that number is closer to 70% by now and instead of cringing along with Republican voters, I can only point my finger and laugh. A lot.By the way, that was 60% of REPUBLICAN primary voters, the most faithful of the faithful. How do you think Republican moderates view the whole thing? Independents? Democrats? Yeah, when Trump wins the nomination, he s going to be utterly crushed in the general election no matter WHO the Democratic nominee is. How can I NOT laugh?It s even funnier to point out, You built that. And they did. So very very much. They fully embraced the incoherent rage and hate of the Tea Party because it won them elections. It didn t matter that your average Tea Partier was completely detached from reality and common decency as long as they voted Republican, attacked Obama and did it loudly. The conservative movement let the fringe take over because it was easier than admitting that the Bush years were a total disaster of their own making.And so the Tea Party dragged the level of discourse into the mud and buried it. They set the bar so low that it s now allowed Donald Trump to run the kind of campaign that used to be unthinkable, filled with vulgarity, violence and idiocy that is an international embarrassment. Even worse, the Democratic primary has been a model of civility between the candidates (if not their followers). It s like watching a family with two well-behaved children and then looking down at your two screaming neurotypical brats throwing temper tantrums. You want to be mad at that other family but all you feel is a burning shame that you failed as a parent somehow.

"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Most of an Islamic State evacuation convoy stuck in east Syria has crossed out of government territory and is no longer the responsibility of the Syrian government or its ally Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shi ite group said on Saturday. A U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State has been using warplanes to prevent the convoy from entering territory held by the jihadists in east Syria. Hezbollah and the Syrian army had escorted it from west Syria as part of a truce deal. The Syrian state and Hezbollah have fulfilled their obligations to transfer buses out of the area of Syrian government control without exposing them, the statement said. Hezbollah said in a statement that the U.S.-led jets were still blocking the convoy of fighters and their families, which was stuck in the desert, and were also stopping any aid from reaching it. Six buses remain in government-held territory under the protection and care of the Syrian state and Hezbollah, the statement said. There were originally 17 buses in the convoy. Hezbollah said there were old people, casualties and pregnant women in the buses stranded outside Syrian government control in the desert and called on the international community to step in to prevent them coming to harm. About 300 lightly armed fighters were traveling on the buses, having surrendered their enclave straddling Syria s border with Lebanon on Monday under a deal which allowed them to join their jihadist comrades on the other side of the country. It angered both the U.S.-led coalition, which does not want more battle-hardened militants in an area where it is operating, and Iraq, which sees them as a threat because the convoy s proposed destination of Al-Bukamal is close to its own border. The Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad, helped by Russia and Iran-backed militias including Hezbollah, is fighting Islamic State as it pushes eastwards across the desert. A commander in the pro-Assad military alliance said earlier on Saturday that Hezbollah and the Syrian army were seeking an alternative way for the convoy to cross into Islamic State territory, having already tried two other routes. Work is under way to change the course of the convoy for a second time, the commander said. The coalition has vowed to continue monitoring the convoy and disrupting any effort it makes to cross into jihadist territory but said it would not bomb it directly because it contains about 300 civilian family members of the fighters. It has asked Russia to tell the Syrian government that it will not allow the convoy to move further east towards the Iraqi border, according to a statement issued late on Friday. On Wednesday, the coalition said its jets had cratered a road and destroyed a bridge to stop the convoy progressing, and had bombed some of the jihadists comrades coming the other way to meet it. Hezbollah and the Syrian army on Thursday changed the route of the convoy from Humeima, a hamlet deep in the southeast desert, to a location further north, but coalition jets again struck near that route, the commander said. It was considered a threat, meaning there was no passage that way, the commander said. On Friday coalition jets made mock air raids over the convoy, the commander added. It caused panic among the Daeshis. The militants are scared the convoy will be bombarded as soon as it enters Deir al-Zor, the commander said, using a plural form of the Arabic acronym for Islamic state to refer to its fighters.",1,fakenewsnet,,Hezbollah says bulk of IS convoy has left Syrian government area

"WASHINGTON/CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt defended on Thursday a new law on non-governmental organizations that three U.S. Republican senators have called “draconian” and a sign of “a growing crackdown on human rights and peaceful dissent”. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein also criticized the law, saying it “effectively hands administration of NGOs to the government”. The law, issued on Monday after being ratified by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, restricts NGO activity to developmental and social work and introduces jail terms of up to five years for non-compliance. Egyptian lawmakers said the law was necessary to protect national security. The government has long accused human rights groups of taking foreign funds to sow chaos and several are facing investigation over their funding. Cairo’s foreign ministry denied the law aimed to restrict NGOs and said some of them “have gotten used to working outside the law ... to defame the image of civil society in Egypt”. In Washington on Wednesday, Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham said in a joint statement: “President al-Sisi’s decision to ratify the draconian legislation ... that regulates the work of non-governmental organizations is the latest sign of a growing crackdown on human rights and peaceful dissent in Egypt.” McCain, who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Graham said the U.S. Congress should in response “strengthen democratic benchmarks and human rights conditions on U.S. assistance for Egypt.” That sentiment was echoed by Senator Marco Rubio, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who said the law would have a “terrible impact” on Egypt’s ability to make reforms and would have implications for U.S.-Egypt relations. “This law is a direct attack on independent civil society in Egypt,” Rubio said in a statement. The UN human rights chief Zeid said on Thursday that the new law makes rights defenders even more vulnerable than before. “The crucial function of these NGOs – to hold the state accountable for its human rights obligations – has been severely hampered already through asset freezes, travel bans, smear campaigns and prosecutions. This new law further tightens the noose,” he said in a statement. In Egypt’s response, foreign ministry spokesman Ahmed Abu Zeid said: “It is important to be vigilant about the intention of some civil society entities that have gotten used to working outside the law, and that were harmed by the issuing of the new law, to defame the image of civil society in Egypt.” Egypt is one of Washington’s closest allies in the Middle East, receiving $1.3 billion in U.S. military aid annually. U.S. President Donald Trump praised Sisi after a meeting in Saudi Arabia last week, saying the Egyptian leader had “done a tremendous job under trying circumstance.”",1,fakenewsnet,,Egypt defends NGO law U.S. senators call a draconian rights crackdown

"Donald Trump s list of allies is getting shorter because of his outrageous accusation against President Obama.During the campaign, Marco Rubio fiercely opposed Trump but soon chose to kiss his ass and endorse him.Rubio has been reluctant to say anything against Trump ever since, but that changed over the weekend after Trump openly accused President Obama of wiretapping Trump Tower in a Saturday morning Twitter rant.Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my wires tapped in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism! Donald J. Trump March 4, 2017How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy! Donald J. Trump March 4, 2017Trump offered zero evidence to back up his claims and both former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and current FBI Director James Comey have forcefully refuted Trump s accusation.And now Rubio, who is on the Senate Intelligence Committee, says that Trump will have to answer for his lies. I have no evidence and no one has presented anything to me that indicates anything like that, Rubio told Meet The Press on Sunday. Suffice it to say I don t have any basis, I ve never heard that allegation made before by anybody. I ve never seen anything about that anywhere before. But again, the president put that out there, and now the White House will have to answer as to exactly what he was referring to. Chuck Todd went on t ask Rubio if he would concede that if Trump is lying that it would be a huge political scandal and Rubio agreed.Here s the video via YouTube:Trump is desperate to distract everyone from focusing on his ever-growing Russia scandal, so he made up this lie based on a conspiracy theory he read on Breitbart in the hopes that Congress and the media will shift their focus.This is a serious accusation against a former president and Trump should be severely punished for it. He has offered no evidence to prove his claim and that means he is slandering President Obama, which should result in a lawsuit and impeachment. But we all know that Republicans in Congress have zero credibility so they will more than likely shield Trump and pursue a witch hunt against Obama, who was a more honorable and respected president than Trump will ever be.Featured image via screenshot",0,fakenewsnet,, WATCH: Marco Rubio Says Trump Will ‘Have To Answer’ For Wiretapping Lies

"German Chancellor Angela Merkel is up for reelection in September, and she s locked in a pretty tight race against Martin Schulz, the former president of the European Parliament. Following the G7 summit, where Trump s childish arrogance was on full display, Schulz simply shredded Trump for his treatment of Merkel: Election campaign or no election campaign, in this situation let me be entirely clear: the chancellor represent all of us at summits like these. And I reject with outrage the way this man takes it upon himself to treat the head of our country s government. That is unacceptable. It is, but it s hard to expect Trump to understand that at this point. In his mind, he s the most important person ever to walk the planet. As such, he was, more or less, a complete asshole during his visit to Europe. He called Germany who, up until now, was our most powerful European ally bad, very bad, for their trade policies. He said that German sells millions of cars in the U.S. and implied that we get nothing from it, so it is going to stop. He proved with those statements that he has no idea that German automakers actually employ thousands of U.S. workers inside U.S. borders.Trump had the gall to castigate NATO, too, for allegedly freeloading off the U.S. as though we make up for the money they aren t spending (in truth, that two percent mark that NATO allies are supposed to reach refers to the percentage of their individual GDPs they need to commit to their national defenses). He also yelled at them for the cost of their new headquarters, almost acting as though we paid for it without voting for it.For her part, Merkel has since said that Germany (and probably NATO) can t rely on us as a partner anymore. That s a dangerous position for us to be in Trump is throwing away everything we ve worked towards with Europe because he s a dickbag.Elsewhere, he showed his total asshattery by shoving the prime minister of Montenegro aside to get to the front of a photo op. His body language there read, Do you know who I am? according to one body language expert who analyzed his postures during that and two other incidents at the summit.Those other two incidents involve French President Macron. The first is when Macron arrived in Italy as he was walking towards the leaders who were already there, Trump stuck his hands out to greet him, but Macron veered toward Merkel to greet her first. He greeted two other leaders before making it to Trump, who then yanked him toward him as though to show him who was boss.Then there was the now-famous white-knuckled handshake with Macron, who admitted that wasn t totally innocent. He wanted to show Trump that France, and by extension, Europe, would not allow Trump to bully them.Some have interpreted Schulz s comments as an attack on Merkel he did appear to also say that she shouldn t have allowed Trump to treat her the way he did but the bottom line is this: When someone s chief political rival takes their side against someone else, that someone else has royally screwed up.Featured image by Olivier Douliery Pool via Getty Images",0,fakenewsnet,, Even Angela Merkel’s Top Political Rival Is Livid With Trump – SLAMS His Treatment Of Her
"ANKARA (Reuters) - Many Iranians who dreamt of quiet, comfortable lives after a nuclear deal with world powers in 2015 are starting to worry for the first time in decades they might be bombed in their own homes. Since taking office last month, U.S. President Donald Trump has pledged to get tough with Iran, warning the Islamic Republic after its ballistic missile test on Sunday that it was playing with fire and all U.S. options were on the table. Analysts say those options could range from diplomacy to military action and some scared Iranians are even preparing escape plans, just as they did in the eight-year war with Iraq when Saddam Hussein’s jets pounded Iranian towns and cities. “I told my children to have their passports ready ... if attacked by Israel or America we can flee to Turkey by car because airports will be closed,” said Ghorbanali Azhari, 65, a retired teacher in the Western city of Kermanshah. “We have had enough. An eight-year war, economic hardship, sanctions ... I cannot let my grandchildren live in fear. There will be bloodshed,” Azhari said. Trump plans to impose sanctions on several Iranian entities following its missile test, while crafting a broader strategy to counter what he sees as Iran’s destabilizing behavior, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday. Iran’s most powerful authority, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has continued to denounce the United States, suggesting the antagonism between the two countries since the 1979 revolution will not abate because of the nuclear deal. “I thought Iran’s political and economic isolation was over ... but now I am deeply concerned about a military strike,” said private bank employee Homayoun Barkhordar. “I do not want war with any country. I love my country. We just want to live in peace,” said the 38-year-old father of two. While experts say both sides would take care to avoid armed confrontation in the oil-rich Gulf, U.S. threats of reprisals for the missile test, coupled with Iran’s defiant reaction, could ratchet up tensions dangerously. “I am thinking of moving to a small town,” said Ali Gharveh in the central city of Isfahan, which was bombed by Iraq during the 1980-88 war. “Life is cheaper and is safer than big cities that might be the main targets if America wants to attack Iran.” The United States and Iran have been at loggerheads since the revolution that toppled the U.S.-backed Shah and Washington cut diplomatic ties when students stormed the U.S. embassy soon after and took 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. The United States and its regional allies accuse Iran of trying to tighten its grip on Arab states, from Iraq to Lebanon, to Syria to Yemen, and Trump has accused former U.S. President Barack Obama of being too kind to Tehran. Days after coming to power, Trump barred residents from seven mainly Muslim countries, including Iran, from traveling to the United States for 90 days. Officials in Iran said Tehran would limit issuing visas to Americans in response. “I always wanted my two children to study in America. But the new government is just spreading hatred towards Iranians,” said Firuzeh Hengam, a computer engineer in the central city of Kashan. “They say no options are off the table. It means attacking Iran is among their options.” But while many Iranians worry about an escalation with the United States, just as they worry about economic hardship at home, they are also loyal and defiant. “Iran is my home no matter who the rulers are. Look at Syrians who left their country because of the war. They are being humiliated ... I do not want to be like them,” said hairdresser Samira Azamzadeh, 47, in the northern city of Rasht. “I don’t have money to go abroad. I am a single mother of two teenage girls.” Iran’s economy has been hit hard by the double hammer blows of years of sanctions over its nuclear program and the plunge in oil prices since the middle of 2014. Iranians had pinned their hopes on economic progress following the nuclear deal, but a year after sanctions were lifted the economy is only recovering slowly and deals with Western investors are few and far between. They now worry that U.S. aggression and the curbs on travel will make wary Western investors even less likely to return to do business with Tehran. “The economic situation will even get worse because of the America’s tough language. It will scare away foreign investors,” said Omid Sadrzadeh, a factory owner in Karaj near the capital Tehran. One former senior Iranian official also said Trump’s approach was playing into the hands of powerful hardliners such as Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). The IRGC controls the country’s missile program and its deputy said on Thursday it had many underground missile facilities hidden in the mountains. “Iran’s hardliners want a war. It will strengthen their position in the establishment. They want Iran to be isolated,” said the official, who asked not to be named. “They will do whatever they can to deepen tension between Iran and America, from launching missiles to giving fiery speeches.” Analysts say Tehran could retaliate against any military strike with hit-and-run attacks in the Gulf and by closing the Strait of Hormuz, the strategic waterway through which some 40 percent of Gulf oil exports pass. Iranian authorities have warned arch-enemy Israel and the United States in the past that Tehran’s response to a military strike would be tough, and some of Iran’s guided missiles have the range to strike Israel. Arash Kiai, a teenager in the central city of Yazd is scared, and angry, both with Trump and Iranian officials. But he will fall in line behind them if it comes to war. “Whatever happens in the world they blame Iran. But why? We are peaceful people,” he said. “I am not an Iran regime supporter but Trump has no right to humiliate Iranians. If attacked, I will fight for Iran.”",1,fakenewsnet,,Iranians fear attacks and economic isolation as Trump gets tough

"DETROIT (Reuters) - Former U.S. presidential candidate Mitt Romney attacked 2016 Republican front-runner Donald Trump as “a fraud” on Thursday and urged primary voters to keep the outspoken New York billionaire from getting the nomination, paving the way for possible horse trading at a party convention in July. In an unusually harsh speech, party elder Romney warned that former reality TV star Trump would likely lose to possible Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 election if he becomes the Republican nominee. Trump’s rise has split the Republican Party between mainstream figures like Romney, and Trump supporters who complain the party does not reflect their concerns about illegal immigration, the slow economic recovery and what they see as America’s diminishing role in the world. That split widened when Romney, the party nominee in 2012, urged Republican primary voters to vote tactically in different states to back Trump’s opponents and block his path to the nomination. “Here’s what I know. Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud,” said Romney, 68, who did not endorse any candidate. “I would vote for Marco Rubio in Florida, for John Kasich in Ohio, and for Ted Cruz or whichever one of the other two contenders has the best chance of beating Mr. Trump in a given state,” he said. Rubio is a U.S. senator from Florida and Kasich is the Ohio governor. By calling for targeted voting, Romney was setting up the possibility of a contested convention when Republicans gather in Cleveland in mid-July to select their nominee for the November election to succeed Democratic President Barack Obama. That could create a pathway to deny Trump the 1,237 delegates needed for nomination. The last Republican convention to go beyond one ballot was in 1948 when Thomas Dewey was nominated. “I think the governor is just being realistic about where things stand and advocating a potential strategy that could stop the Trump nomination,” said former Romney spokesman Ryan Williams. Republican strategist Scott Reed said he doubted the last-ditch tactical voting suggestion would work. “No one will be playing the targeted voting game. There’s too much anger and distrust,” Reed said. Trump, 69, has made his party’s establishment uneasy with his abrasive tone and policy positions, including plans to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border, deport 11 million illegal immigrants and temporarily bar Muslims from entering the country. More than 90 Republican national security leaders have signed a scathing open letter opposing Trump and his stance on many foreign policy issues. Romney’s speech in Utah was the spearhead of a mainstream Republican attempt to rein in Trump after he won most states in this week’s Republican Super Tuesday nominating contests and took a step toward earning the nomination. The address came hours before Trump and his rivals shared a stage in Detroit at 9 p.m. EST for a debate hosted by Fox News. Trump leads many polls for primaries in the remaining states, including in major ones like Florida on March 15, dampening prospects of derailing him. The party establishment’s strategy risks backfiring by further energizing Trump’s supporters, many of them white, blue-collar voters. “If only Romney talked like this four years ago about Obama ... or Trump,” conservative political commentator Michelle Malkin said on Twitter. “Too freaking late and too freaking lame.” Trump dismissed the former Massachusetts governor who lost to Obama four years ago. “Mitt is a failed candidate. He failed. He failed horribly. He failed badly,” Trump told a rally in Maine. Romney decided on his own to give the speech, which he wrote himself. Romney said Trump’s economic policy would sink America “into prolonged recession,” mocked Trump’s ego, and called him a “con man.” “A business genius he is not,” Romney said. David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to Obama, called the Romney speech a “break glass” moment he had not seen since 1964, when Republicans abandoned their candidate Barry Goldwater. Axelrod noted thousands of Republicans had already voted for Trump in primary elections. “I wonder about tactic of calling them fools,” Axelrod wrote on Twitter.

"MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte retained a high public approval rating in an opinion poll released on Friday, a stark contrast to a different survey earlier this week that showed a sharp decline in trust and satisfaction in the maverick leader. Eighty percent of 1,200 Filipinos surveyed by pollster Pulse Asia late last month said they trust and approve of Duterte slightly down from 81 percent and 82 percent respectively in its June survey. Approval rates the president s performance and trust relates to his personality in the Pulse survey, which did not ask respondents to give a reason. A poll by Social Weather Stations conducted at the same time and released on Sunday showed trust and satisfaction in Duterte - also ratings of personality and performance - fell to the lowest of his presidency. The falls by 15 points and 18 points respectively were significant, and came after a demonstration by thousands of Filipinos and unprecedented public scrutiny on his war on drugs, triggered by the Aug. 16 killing by police of a teenager. Thousands of Filipinos have been killed during the past 15 months. Police insist none were executed, as activists have alleged. Duterte this week ordered police to stand down from the campaign but has not said what motivated his decision. His office said that was to shift focus towards bigger targets. Analysts were unable to explain the big difference in the results of surveys by two well-respected pollsters. Academic Edmund Tayao said the Pulse poll showed the public still recognized the importance of the war on drugs, and Duterte would stick to his policy agenda. The president s tone does not change, regardless of the numbers, Tayao said. Whether these surveys will result in major changes to his policy, I think not. Ranjit Rye of the University of the Philippines said the latest poll showed that, despite recent setbacks and adverse headlines, Duterte had not lost his appeal. Despite all the political noise, all the opposition against the president, he continues to be wildly popular and people approve of his leadership, Rye said. Presidential spokesman Ernesto Abella said there was an enormous amount of appreciation for Duterte, and suggested the earlier poll may have been some form of orchestrated information, disinformation . It s not for us to speculate. But there seems to be that particular effort in order to the put the president and his administration in a particular light, he told reporters.",1,fakenewsnet,,New poll shows Philippine president still hugely popular

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump on Monday vowed an unbreakable U.S. alliance with Israel if he is elected president in November, seeking to clear up confusion over his repeated pledges to remain neutral in any peace negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians. Trump’s speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a powerful pro-Israel lobbying group, was part of a daylong effort by the anti-Washington candidate to persuade establishment Republicans to get behind his insurgent candidacy and give up on an effort to deny him the party’s presidential nomination. Describing Israel as ready to negotiate a peace agreement, Trump said the Palestinians would have to be willing to accept that Israel will forever exist as a Jewish state and able to stop attacks on Israelis. “The Palestinians must come to the table knowing that the bond between the United States and Israel is unbreakable,” the New York billionaire businessman said. Trump has drawn fire for his position on Middle East peace negotiations. He has described himself as extremely pro-Israel, but has said he would take a “neutral” stance in trying to negotiate an elusive peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians. Trump’s critics have said he could harm long-standing U.S. support for Israel. Trump’s leading Republican rival, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, reminded the AIPAC gathering of Trump’s position. “Let me be very, very clear,” Cruz said. “As president I will not be neutral. America will stand unapologetically with the nation of Israel.” Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton, a former secretary of state, used her AIPAC appearance to attack Trump. “We need steady hands, not a president who says he’s neutral on Monday, pro-Israel on Tuesday and who-knows-what on Wednesday because everything’s negotiable,” she said. Clinton also took aim at Trump’s vow that, if elected, he would deport illegal immigrants and bar Muslims temporarily from entering the United States. “If you see bigotry, oppose it, if you see violence, condemn it, if you see a bully, stand up to him,” she said. In a rarity, Trump delivered his AIPAC speech with the aid of a TelePrompter, abandoning his typical free-wheeling style. Throughout the day, his public remarks lacked their usual bombast, an obvious effort to appear more presidential. At a news conference, Trump presented himself as Republicans’ best chances of capturing the White House in the Nov. 8 election. He took steps to appear as the nominee-in-waiting, releasing the names of some foreign policy advisers and pledging to name seven to 10 people he would pick for the Supreme Court. Trump said establishment Republicans would be making a mistake if they persuade a high-profile party leader to launch a third-party run to deny him the White House. He said it would “almost certainly” mean the Democrats would win the presidency. “If people want to be smart, they should embrace this movement,” Trump said at the site of a new hotel he is building in Washington. “If they don’t want to be smart, they should do what they’re doing now and the Republicans are going to go down to a massive loss.” Trump laid out some foreign policy priorities in a CNN interview, saying the United States is contributing more than it should to the NATO alliance and that he would continue a U.S. thaw toward Cuba begun by President Barack Obama, who is now in Havana. Trump was in Washington for closed-door talks with a variety of Republicans organized by his top backer in the capital, U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama. It was his most overt bid yet to seek party unity at a time when many establishment Republicans bitterly oppose him. The meeting, held at the offices of the Jones Day law firm, included some Republican lawmakers and a former Republican speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, Newt Gingrich, and former Congressman Bob Livingston. “We’ve had almost eight years of Mr. Obama, who’s been a disastrous president. We have now an opportunity to change course or have four more years of the same. And I think that Donald Trump is the alternative,” Livingston said after the session. Also at the meeting were Representatives Renee Ellmers of North Carolina and Chris Collins of New York, as well as former Senator Jim DeMint, who is head of the Heritage Foundation, an influential conservative Washington think-tank. In a separate session with the Washington Post editorial board, Trump named some members of his foreign policy team. The team included Walid Phares, who Trump called a counter-terrorism expert; George Papadopoulos, an oil and energy consultant; and Joe Schmitz, a former inspector general at the Department of Defense. Trump’s rise has alarmed establishment Republicans who have tried in vain to stop him. Their best hope of derailing his insurgent candidacy is to stretch the contest out and deny him the 1,237 delegates needed to formally win the party’s presidential nomination. Trump has 678 delegates to 423 for Cruz and 143 for Ohio Governor John Kasich, according to the Associated Press. If Trump does not win the 1,237 delegates, the Republican nominee would be decided at the party’s convention in Cleveland in July.",1,fakenewsnet,,"Trump vows strong U.S. ties with Israel, draws fire from Clinton"

"A new poll conducted in South Carolina on the heels of the state s Republican primary reveals the true extent of hatred from Donald Trump s base and it is terrifying.Currently, Trump is expected to easily win South Carolina. His nearest competitor isn t even close. The landslide is so bad that Trump has hardly had to campaign in the state, while others scramble to fight for second place. What makes Trump so popular? A look at the values these voters hold gives us the disturbing answer.Public Policy Polling asked South Carolinians several questions about issues Trump has alluded to on the campaign trail and found that many of them support his most hateful rhetoric. Some even feel he doesn t go far enough.On the question of banning Muslims from entering the United States, one third of Trump s supporters said they would like to add homosexuals to the Can Not Enter list. No other candidate s supporters came even close to that level of intolerance. But they weren t finished.There s also 62/23 support among Trump voters for creating a national database of Muslims and 40/36 support for shutting down all the mosques in the United States, something no one else s voters back. Only 44% of Trump voters think the practice of Islam should even be legal at all in the United States, to 33% who think it should be illegal. To put all the views toward Muslims in context though, 32% of Trump voters continue to believe the policy of Japanese internment during World War II was a good one The message is clear: Making America Great Again means purging everyone who isn t white and Christian.Trump s supporters also felt that slavery wasn t so bad, either. In fact, 38 percent of them said they wished the South had won the Civil War. Another 38 percent weren t sure. As PPP dryly put it, Trump s were the only one[s] whose supporters actually wish the South had won. Needless to say, an overwhelming majority of his fans (70 percent) felt that the Confederate flag should still be flying over the State Capital.And as if all of those wistful call-backs to a time when white people owned black people were just too subtle, a full 16% of Trump s supporters say they think whites are the superior race the only candidate to have double digit support for this racist concept.Following Trump s latest snafu (During the debate, he correctly pointed out that George W. Bush had been president during 9/11. A Republican no-no.), there was some speculation that he would suffer in the polls. That appears to not be the case. It is Ted Cruz, in fact, who was found to be the most unlikable candidate in the race. (No surprise there, everyone hates Ted Cruz once they get to know him.) Meanwhile, Trump has actually gained a few points since the debate.It s clear that targeting Trump on any particular gaffe or talking point won t work. Trump s supporters are fanatical, singularly focused, and fueled by intolerance and hatred. Trump can continue to attack his fellow Republicans or their beloved George W. Bush just as long as he doesn t forget to mock and scapegoat minorities as well. His base demands it.It is often said that Trump s popularity is due to his ability to say what others won t. If that s the case, he s saying an awful lot about the toxic underbelly of the Republican Party.Featured image from Flickr/Alex Hanson",0,fakenewsnet,, 38% Of Trump Supporters Wish South Had Won Civil War And Other Disgusting Findings In New Poll

"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Former Russian economy minister Alexei Ulyukayev, accused of extorting a bribe, told a court on Monday he thought a bag holding $2 million in cash which he took from Rosneft (ROSN.MM) chief executive Igor Sechin held a gift of expensive alcohol. Ulyukayev faces up to 15 years in prison if found guilty of accepting the $2 million cash from Sechin, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin. Prosecutors said the bribe was given last year on Nov. 14 in exchange for Ulyukayev approving the sale of a state-controlled oil company Bashneft (BANE.MM) to Rosneft. Police detained Ulyukayev inside Rosneft headquarters shortly after Sechin handed him the cash inside a lockable brown bag and a little basket with sausage as a gift, prosecutors said. . The next day Putin fired Ulyukayev. Ulyukayev, speaking to the court, said he had believed the package contained a gift but that a trap had been set for him. All this was an action directed against me, planned in advance, a provocation organized in advance, he said. Ulyukayev s lawyers are trying to explain to the court why he accepted the bag from Sechin given that - according to transcripts of their conversations - neither man had discussed what was inside. Ulyukayev said when he had been economy minister, Sechin had visited his ministry two or three times and usually had come to the office with a bulky bag, containing presents. During that period, Sechin personally presented Ulyukayev with a watch and a model of an oil-derrick, and he sent a food hamper on occasions such as birthdays, Ulyukayev said. Ulyukayev had also received alcoholic drinks from Sechin as gifts, a prosecutor said. That was a norm of etiquette, from Sechin s point of view, Ulyukayev told the court. The ex-minister said the bag which Sechin gave him last year at Rosneft headquarters in a law enforcement sting operation weighed about 15 kg (33 lbs) and he thought there had been expensive wine or spirits inside. Ulyukayev said that a month before, Sechin promised to present him with a wine he had never tried before in his life to mark the successful closing of the Bashneft privatization deal. For that reason it came as a surprise that the bag contained money, Ulyukayev said. Sechin has been issued with four summonses to testify in the trial, but has failed to show up, despite being a key witness. His lawyer said in a letter to the court that Sechin had been away on business trips.",1,fakenewsnet,,Ex-Russian minister says he thought bag with $2 million cash was gift of alcohol

"ANKARA (Reuters) - The Turkish government has launched an investigation into a poster unfurled by fans of Istanbul s Galatasaray soccer team that pro-Turkish media said was clearly linked to organizers of the 2016 attempted coup. Just before Sunday s match kicked between Galatasaray and local rivals Fenerbahce, the home fans opened a giant red and yellow poster behind the goal showing Sylvester Stallone s famous fictional boxer Rocky , with the caption Stand Up and They look big because you are kneeling. Pro-government Turkish media linked the poster and its caption to the network of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Ankara accuses of masterminding the July 2016 failed coup attempt. Pro-government daily Takvim said the poster was a reference to a speech by Gulen, where he was quoted reading from a poem that ends with the words Stand Up Sakarya . Sakarya is a province in northwest Turkey. Prime Minister Binali Yildirim on Monday ordered authorities to carry out an investigation into the poster, sources from his office said. The game between Galatasaray and Fenerbahce, Turkey s biggest fixture, ended in a 0-0 draw after a match that was marred by violence in which a referee was injured. In a statement, Galatasaray said the accusations were a pathetic attempt to discredit the club, adding that the same poster was used at a match in May. We will use all our legal rights against any institution, person and social media account who tried to put the Galatasaray name next to that of the red-handed leader of the heinous terrorist organisation by using the choreography as an excuse, the club said on its website. Some 50,000 people have been jailed pending trial over suspected links to last year s failed coup and more than 150,000 have been sacked or suspended from their jobs in the military, public and private sectors. Rights groups and Turkey s Western allies have said President Tayyip Erdogan is using the failed coup as a pretext to crush dissent, but the government says the measures are necessary to fight the threats it is facing. Following the statement from Yildirim s office, Galatasaray s shares were down 4.89 percent as of 1535 GMT. Current league leaders Galatasaray are Turkey s most decorated soccer club, with 20 league championships, and became the first Turkish club to win a major European trophy when they won the 2000 UEFA Cup, the predecessor to the Europa league.",1,fakenewsnet,,Turkey to investigate Galatasaray's 'Rocky' poster over coup links

But the meeting backfired as even more Republicans leaned against the bill after hearing Trump speak.The cancellation of Thursday s vote infuriated Trump, who proceeded to demand a vote on Friday and Republican leaders reluctantly caved.And so, Paul Ryan spent time fruitlessly begging his Republican colleagues to throw their support behind a bad bill that would have stripped healthcare from over 20 million Americans and caused the cost of healthcare premiums to skyrocket.One lawmaker Ryan approached was Alaska Rep.

"At 2:40 PM today, an unidentified male entered the U.S. Capitol Visitor Center with a gun. The man was captured, and a police officer and female bystander were reportedly injured, but not seriously. The gunman was also injured and was taken to the hospital.The gunman reportedly tried to go through metal detectors with the weapon. When the detectors went off, and security confronted the man, he pulled out his gun, when he was shot by a police officer.The Capitol and buildings in the area were placed on lockdown for roughly half an hour, causing some confusion as there was a lockdown drill in the Capitol earlier this morning. The visitor center is still closed, but the House and Senate reopened for official business purposes only. Although Congress is not currently in session due to a break for Easter, Washington DC is flooded with tourists this time of year for its annual Cherry Blossom Festival.The incident was deemed as isolated by local police.The visitor center at the Capitol was built via an underground center with high security after two Capitol police officers were killed in 1998 by a paranoid schizophrenic who entered the building and opened fire in 1998. Similar incidents have historically occurred at the Capitol as it is a high target for gunmen who want to ensure they receive national media attention.In April 2015, a male entered the Capitol building with a gun and committed suicide.Details from the Capitol shooting today are still emerging as to who the shooter is, what is plans were, and what were his motives for trying to bring a gun into the Capitol.Featured image courtesy of Flickr",0,fakenewsnet,, Shooting Reported At Capitol; Gunman In Custody
"The woman who accused Donald Trump of raping her at age 13 has dropped her lawsuit after canceling a press conference slated for the middle of next week, and nobody knows why. However, she canceled the press conference because she had been getting death threats, and was too terrified to show up.On Wednesday, Lisa Bloom, the lawyer who organized the press conference that Ms. Doe canceled, said: Jane Doe has received numerous threats today, as have all the Trump accusers that I have represented.She is living in fear. She has decided that she is too afraid to show her face. She s been here all day ready to do it. But unfortunately she is in terrible fear. So it s entirely possible that Trump, his people, his supporters, and/or other misogynists literally terrorized her into dropping the suit. Her fears would be well-founded, too, given that Trump allegedly threatened her if she told anyone how he d violated her. One witness said: I personally witnessed Defendant Trump telling the Plaintiff that she shouldn t ever say anything if she didn t want to disappear like the 12-year-old female Maria, and that he was capable of having her whole family killed. That adds some credence to the possibility that she dropped the suit out of fear. She very likely stayed silent all this time because she was terrified of what would happen to her should she come forward. Now she s receiving death threats, which must seem to her like her worst fears coming true. It s horrific.On Friday, Jeffrey Meagher, Ms. Doe s lead attorney, simply filed a one-page notice dismissing the case without explanation. It merely reads: Pursuant to F.R.C.P. 41(a)(1)(A)(i) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Plaintiff, by and through her counsel, hereby gives notice that the above-captioned action is voluntarily dismissed against the Defendants. She may or may not be able to file this claim again, and her attorneys would have explained that to her. However, if she s being terrorized the way it sounds and that s entirely plausible given the really despicable natures of Trump and everyone close to him she may just want to let it rest and hope to live out the rest of her life in relative peace. That does not make her a liar, though, as many will no doubt say.

"SAN JUAN (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Democrats, in a letter to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, on Wednesday called for congressional action on Puerto Rico, demanding that legislation to resolve the island’s financial crisis include tools to restructure debt. “Restructuring legislation would not cost the federal government a single penny and would instead save U.S. taxpayers from the growing cost of inaction,” said the letter to the Senate’s Republican leader, signed by all 46 Democrats and independents. The letter is a challenge to Republicans who largely oppose letting the U.S. commonwealth restructure debt. Republican Senators Orrin Hatch of Utah, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Chuck Grassley of Iowa last month introduced a bill to bring Puerto Rico’s finances under federal oversight without providing for debt restructuring. Democrats have argued that federal oversight should be conditional on allowing Puerto Rico to be governed by federal bankruptcy or debt restructuring laws. Hatch, Murkowski and Grassley are cc’d on the letter. “Puerto Rico was included in Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code until 1984, when Congress inexplicably excluded it from the nationwide approach to resolving municipal insolvency,” said the letter, a draft of which was first reported by Reuters last week. The letter’s broad support is key because, with 44 Democrats and two independents on board, Democrats could block bills that do not include a restructuring mechanism. Still, that is no guarantee that Republicans, who control Congress, will draft a bill that includes one. A restructuring option would be a coup for the island’s governor, Alejandro Garcia Padilla, who has long said Puerto Rico needs to cut its $70 billion in debt to grow its economy, a stance that has faced resistance from creditors. Aside from its debt load, Puerto Rico faces widespread economic strain, including a 45 percent poverty rate and a shrinking tax base, as a growing number of citizens jump to the U.S. mainland. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid, speaking on the Senate floor on Wednesday, said Congress must do more than hold hearings or create a task force on Puerto Rico, stressing that the island needs “to be treated as other American citizens and be able to file bankruptcy.” The letter comes weeks after House Speaker Paul Ryan demanded legislation by the end of March to address Puerto Rico. “We urge you to match his commitment to act ... by the end of the first quarter,” said the letter to McConnell.",1,fakenewsnet,,Senate Democrats united on debt restructuring for Puerto Rico: letter

"A new movie about the Clinton Grifters couldn t be coming-out at a better time the day before the Democratic convention! The book that raked through the complex web of political, campaign fundraising, and political practices of Bill and Hillary Clinton last year and muddied Clinton s presidential campaign launch is coming to the big screen just in time to cause Clinton trouble in the general election. Clinton Cash is set to premiere the day before the Democratic convention in Philadelphia, and is based on the book by the same title by author Peter Schweizer.Schweizer is joined by fellow producer Stephan K. Bannon of conservative outlet Breitbart news on the project.A trailer for the film, which is directed by M.A. Taylor., features images of blood dripping down piles of cash, Bloomberg News reported.The trailer kicks off with clip of Clinton complimenting foreign governments for rooting out corruption even as Schweizer, who is interviewed as part of the film, says the Clintons created a model for massive self enrichment that allows you to go into so-called pub service but get extremely rich at the same time. The book s release in May prompted a series of investigations by major news outlets into the fundraising practices of the Clinton foundation, which had accepted major contributions from corporations and foreign governments.It also probed hefty speaking fees earned by the Clintons from foreign and domestic corporations after Bill Clinton left the White House, the foundation s charity work, and Clinton s time at the State Department.Read more: Daily Mail",0,fakenewsnet,,PERFECT TIMING!

"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Relief supplies and volunteers are piling up at rescue sites in upscale districts of Mexico City following Tuesday s deadly earthquake in a show of solidarity that has contrasted with the government s struggle to get aid to people most in need. In the wealthy neighborhoods of Roma and Condesa in the center of Mexico City, volunteers by the hundreds stand ready to help dig for survivors who may be trapped beneath the rubble. In recent days, however, they have largely remained idle. Others have brought food and water, eager to tend to rescue workers or the thousands of people made homeless by the quake. Yet they have struggled to find takers because so much sustenance is on offer. In the poor, far-flung neighborhoods in the outskirts of the capital, meanwhile, aid and comfort were less abundant. And in villages in some states surrounding the Mexico City, victims said they had yet to see government aid arrive. In the hard-hit Mexico City neighborhood of Del Valle, 48-year-old Marcela Sanchez came in search of aid after she lost her home in the large, working-class area of Nezahualcoyotl, in the remote northeast suburbs. We haven t received any aid, Sanchez said. Those of us who work in Mexico City return home with aid. God willing, they can help us. The government s response to Tuesday s quake, which killed 319 people in Mexico City and surrounding states, is under scrutiny ahead of presidential elections next year. Earthquakes are politically sensitive after the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party s flawed response to the 1985 earthquake that killed thousands. The government s handling of this disaster is markedly better than it was 32 years ago, when days passed before rescues began at many buildings. That disaster led to more rigorous building codes and regular quake drills. The lasting memory of the 2017 quake may be the outpouring of voluntary action, but also the unevenness of the relief operations and the lack of government coordination of resources. There s plenty (of provisions and aid workers). All that s missing here is emergency management, said Roberto Hernandez, founder of Los Topos, or The Moles, a civilian rescue squad that rose to prominence after the 1985 earthquake. The government response is being coordinated by the Civil Protection unit of the Interior Ministry, which did not immediately make an official available for comment. President Enrique Pena Nieto s office did not respond to requests for comment. A combination of Mexican government employees, police, soldiers and sailors as well as foreign aid teams and hordes of civilian volunteers have cleared buildings of debris, rescued some 69 people and recovered bodies. But the enormous logistical task of marshalling those resources has appeared wanting. Even in the best of times, coordinating action among myriad government agencies in Mexico is complicated, and volunteers and victims have complained that the overlapping jurisdictions have thwarted relief efforts. While rescuers work around the clock at disaster sites, dozens of police and military forces are left without any apparent task, sometimes just standing by, inactive. Hernandez, of Los Topos, complained about the slow pace of removing debris at a collapsed office building in Roma. While rescuers in hard hats worked atop the ruins, scores of uniformed police and soldiers appeared to have little to do. We need to break up slabs and bring them down to look for bodies or survivors. We did this 32 years ago and saved 137 people, Hernandez said. Look at them (police officers). Every one of them would be willing to pick up a couple of rocks if you asked them. The mayor of Mexico City said in an interview with broadcaster TV Azteca that the official response was improving. We have stuck to the contingency plan without reticence. We are working hand-in-hand with the navy, with the army, with the federal police, Mayor Miguel Angel Mancera said. That contention may be lost on people in the states of Morelos and Puebla, closer to the epicenter of the 7.1 magnitude quake, where in some villages victims said the government had not arrived. Instead, caravans of volunteers from the capital traveled backroads and waded through rivers to deliver aid to remote populations. Even in relatively close neighborhoods, such as San Geronimo on the capital s southern extreme where many of the modest adobe and brick homes crumbled or cracked and road damage has impeded access, residents complained aid was slow to arrive and not nearly as abundant as in the upscale neighborhoods close to the city center. We have not had any support from the authorities, said Antonio Ramirez, a retired teacher who was surveying damaged homes. The support has been from ordinary people. Even the soldiers, instead of bringing picks and shovels, brought their machine guns.",1,fakenewsnet,,"While wealthy Mexicans swamped by quake aid, poor feel abandoned"

"21st Century Wire says While everyone is busy hyping the North Korean nuclear threat , the one thing that few mainstream media outlets dare to ask about North Korea is: do they actually have an operational nuclear weapons program?Here s your answer: No.To date, there is no evidence at all that Pyongyang has an operational nuclear weapons program, much less a capable or accurate enough ballistic missile program that could deliver such weapons.The Dear Leader: Kim Jung-UnThe usual western sources (media reportage and intelligence sources) claim that North Korea conducted atomic bomb tests in 2006, 2009 and 2013 although none of these can be independently verified yet. So again, the answer, so far has to be no.North Korea also claimed that it tested a hydrogen bomb in January 2016. Understandably, FOX News loves these Pyongyang propaganda claims as it bolsters the military defense industry global threat talking point, but again, this has not yet been independently verified yet.The fundamental question should be: if Pyongyang has nukes, and no one has actually seen them, including Washington spooks, then why is the media hyping their existence? The Washington Post admitted as much in 2013, when a former senior Obama administration official admitted there s no actual evidence of any such weapons, saying, We re worried about it, but we haven t seen it .The rest is just expensive guesswork, and US military industrial complex fear mongering.Perhaps the real story is that a divided Korea (between north and south) provides the US with its sole justification for carrying on occupying its many military installations in Japan, the Philippines and numerous other Pacific archipelago installations.In other words it pays for the North Korean nuclear threat to be real. Understandably, the war hawks and other flamboyant info-tainment personalities will not be happy with this statement made yesterday by US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who instead called for diplomacy with Pyongyang RT International reports Washington does not seek regime change in North Korea and at some point would like to have a dialogue with Pyongyang to de-escalate the tensions on the peninsula, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has said. We do not seek a regime change; we do not seek the collapse of the regime; we do not seek an accelerated reunification of the peninsula; we do not seek an excuse to send our military north of the 38th parallel, Tillerson told reporters Tuesday in Washington DC.Despite repeated warnings from Washington that the US might resort to a military solution to curb Pyongyang s nuclear and missile programs, Tillerson stressed that the US is trying to convey to the North Koreans that we are not your enemy we are not your threat. But, he said, North Korea continues to present an unacceptable threat to the United States, which forces Washington to respond. Tillerson however expressed hope that Washington and Pyongyang can resolve their issues through negotiations. We would like to sit and have a dialogue with them about the future that will give them the security they seek and the future economic prosperity for North Korea, Tillerson said.Secretary Tillerson on #DPRK: United States and China share the same objective, a denuclearized Korean Peninsula. pic.twitter.com/Znaoq4OOlr Department of State August 2, 2017Continue this article at RT READ MORE NORTH KOREA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire North Korea FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",0,fakenewsnet,,"Tillerson to North Korea: ‘We Are Not Your Enemy’ – US Seeks Dialogue, Not Regime Change"

"BALTIMORE (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is expected to name the chief executive of Exxon Mobil Corp as the country’s top diplomat, a source familiar with the situation said on Saturday, an appointment that would put in place an official with close ties to the Russian government. News of Rex Tillerson’s possible appointment comes as U.S. intelligence analysts have concluded that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Trump win the White House. The choice of Tillerson further stocks Trump’s Cabinet and inner circle with people who favor a soft line toward Moscow. Tillerson, 64, has driven Exxon’s expansion in Russia for decades and opposed U.S. sanctions imposed on Russia for its seizure of Crimea. Russian President Vladimir Putin awarded Tillerson Russia’s Order of Friendship, one of the country’s highest civilian honors. Exxon’s Tillerson emerged on Friday as Trump’s leading candidate for U.S. secretary of state over 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and three other people. Tillerson met with Trump for more than two hours at Trump Tower on Saturday morning. It was their second meeting about the position this week. The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Tillerson was the expected pick but cautioned no formal offer had yet been made. A senior official on the Trump transition team said the president-elect was close to picking Tillerson. Trump spokesman Jason Miller said no announcement on the high-profile job was forthcoming in the immediate future. “Transition Update: No announcements on Secretary of State until next week at the earliest. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain,” he tweeted. Trump on Saturday attended the Army-Navy football game in Baltimore, where he was joined by former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who withdrew from consideration as secretary of state on Friday. NBC News, which first reported the development, said Trump would also name John Bolton, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, as deputy secretary of state. As Exxon’s CEO, Tillerson oversees operations in more than 50 countries, including Russia. In 2011, Exxon signed a deal with Rosneft, Russia’s largest state-owned oil company, for joint oil exploration and production. Since then, the companies have formed 10 joint ventures for projects in Russia. Tillerson and Rosneft chief Igor Sechin announced plans to begin drilling in the Russian Arctic for oil as part of their joint venture, in spite of U.S. sanctions. In July, Tillerson was one of the highest-profile U.S. representatives at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, one of Putin’s main investment forums, even as Washington had been taking a harder line than Europe on maintaining sanctions. Trump has pledged to work for stronger U.S. ties with Russia, which have been strained by Putin’s incursion into Crimea and his support for Syrian President Bashir al-Assad. In a preview from an interview to be aired on “Fox News Sunday,” Trump said Tillerson is “much more than a business executive.” “I mean, he’s a world class player,” Trump said. “He’s in charge of an oil company that’s pretty much double the size of his next nearest competitor. It’s been a company that has been unbelievably managed.” “And to me, a great advantage is he knows many of the players, and he knows them well. He does massive deals in Russia,” Trump said. Tillerson’s Russian ties figure to be a factor in any Senate confirmation hearing. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain, a long-time Putin critic, told Fox News that he does not know what Tillerson’s relationship with Putin has been, “but I’ll tell you, it is a matter of concern to me.” Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee raised concerns in a memo on Saturday citing Trump’s “cavalier dismissal” of U.S. intelligence reports that Russia interfered in U.S. elections and the appointment of Tillerson, who has “business ties to Russia and Vladimir Putin, and whose company worked to bury and deny climate science for years.” Should Tillerson be nominated, climate change could be another controversial issue for him. The company is under investigation by the New York Attorney General’s Office for allegedly misleading investors, regulators and the public on what it knew about global warming. Tillerson is, however, one of the few people selected for roles in the Trump administration to believe that human activity causes climate change. After Trump’s election, Exxon came out in support of the Paris Climate Agreement and said it favors a carbon tax as an emissions-cutting strategy.

"CAIRO/RAMALLAH (Reuters) - Hamas has agreed to dissolve the administration that runs Gaza, it said on Sunday, a major step towards handing control of the enclave to a Palestinian unity government after a decade of bitter rivalry with President Mahmoud Abbas. The Islamist group, which has ruled Gaza since a brief Palestinian civil war in 2007, said it had taken a courageous, serious and patriotic decision to dissolve the administrative committee that runs the territory of 2 million people, and hand power to some form of unity government. Reunification a decade after Hamas and Abbas s secular Fatah movement battled for control of Gaza may hinge on whether complex issues related to power-sharing - which stymied reconciliation bids in the past - can be resolved. Abbas welcomed Hamas move - a result of talks mediated by Egypt - and said he would convene the Palestinian leadership for discussions upon his return from New York where he was attending the U.N. General Assembly. The development would enable the formation of a national reconciliation government to work in the Gaza Strip and hold ... elections, he said in a statement on official news agency WAFA. Earlier, a Palestinian government spokesman said Cairo s mediation had presented a historic opportunity that could help Palestinians toward full statehood. But Fatah said it still needed clarification from Hamas on the handing over of government ministries in Gaza and control of the enclave s border crossings with Israel and Egypt. Hamas and Fatah agreed in 2014 to form a national reconciliation administration but could not agree on the details. A unity government formed after Hamas won the last Palestinian general election, in 2006, was short-lived. Aiming to pressure Hamas to relinquish control of Gaza, Abbas cut payments to Israel for the electricity it supplies to the enclave, leading to power provided for less than four hours on some days, and never more than six hours a day. Azzam Al-Ahmad, who headed Fatah s delegation to the talks in Cairo, told WAFA: This step will enhance the unity of the Palestinians and end ugly division. The two parties did not meet at the talks which took the form of shuttle-diplomacy with Egyptian officials mediating. Ahmad said the two sides planned to meet face-to-face but gave no date. Other Palestinian factions would join the talks later to discuss practical steps to implement the agreement, he added. Mending fences with Western-backed Abbas would be another step in Hamas diplomatic push to improve relations with its neighbor Egypt, which has kept its frontier with Gaza largely closed and accused the group in the past of aiding Islamist militants in Egypt s Sinai desert, something Hamas denies. The United Nations envoy welcomed Sunday s news. All parties must seize this opportunity to restore unity and open a new page for the Palestinian people, U.N. Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process Nickolay Mladenov said in a statement, adding that the U.N. was ready to assist the talks in order to alleviate hardship in Gaza. Mladenov thanked Egypt for its tireless efforts in creating this positive momentum. Some opinion polls have showed that if parliamentary elections were held now, Hamas would win both in Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank, the seat of Abbas s Palestinian Authority. Abbas, 82, is 12 years into what was meant to be a four-year term as president and opinion polls show him to be unpopular. He has no clear successor and no new presidential election appears imminent.",1,fakenewsnet,,Hamas says ready to hand Gaza to a Palestinian unity government

"(Editors note: Attention to language in paragraph 30 that may be offensive to some readers) By Jason Szep ELLSWORTH, Maine (Reuters) - “He lies,” huffed Janet Foster. “And he’s a dirty old man,” chimed in her sister Jean as they discussed Donald Trump’s flaws a few days before he was elected the new president of the United States. “Well, I am with him,” their brother Paul, 60, interjected, raising his voice over snacks of cheese, muffins and crackers in the family’s living room. “Hillary Clinton is like a puppet - you know it’s all scripted.” The 2016 U.S. election was unprecedented in the way it turned Americans against each other, according to dozens of interviews in rural United States and across some of the most politically charged battleground states. It divided families like the Fosters in rural Ellsworth, Maine, broke up friendships and turned neighbor against neighbor. In a recent Reuters/Ipsos survey, 15 percent of respondents said they had stopped talking to a family member or close friend as a result of the election. For Democrats, this shoots up to 23 percent, compared to 10 percent for Republicans. And 12 percent had ended a relationship because of it. There was no comparative polling data from previous elections. But interviews with relationship counselors and voters suggest this election stood out by summoning passions, anger and a divisiveness in ways that will make healing difficult after Clinton’s loss to Trump on Tuesday. Sarah Guth, a Democrat in Colorado, says her father - an ardent supporter of Trump - no longer speaks with her after they clashed on Facebook over their political views. “He crossed a line,” she said. After attending a Trump rally, Guth wrote on Facebook that she saw 10 minorities among thousands of people. “I’m increasingly convinced that this election is about race,” she wrote. “I mean a fear among the white majority that their rule is coming to an end.” Some posters told her “to go to hell,” she recalled in an interview. “And then my dad very publicly attacked me, telling me that I should be ashamed of myself.” The two have not spoken since. Ty Turner-Bond, a 35-year-old black man in North Carolina, says he lost friends because of his support for Trump. Some called him an “Uncle Tom,” a slur for African Americans accused of deferring to white people; others threatened violence. In Springfield, a city on Ohio’s Mad River, Duke Level, 57, voted for Trump because he wanted “a wrecking ball” to hit Washington. The owner of Un Mundo Cafe isn’t surprised this election created divisions, and he fears they could get worse. “This is one of those crossroads crisis moments in history,” he said. Hours earlier, Trump rallied about 5,000 supporters a few miles away in a dirt-floored livestock arena. He blasted Clinton as “the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the presidency,” drawing chants of “lock her up,” as well as a few of “string her up.” Down the street, Richard Scott, 51, an African-American supporting Clinton, shook his head when told of those chants. Those words, he said, recalled 20th Century lynchings of black Americans - including in Springfield where a black prisoner was shot and hung from a pole on Main Street in 1904. “It’s terrible,” he said. Weeks ago, he planted a Clinton sign in his yard. His neighbors put up Trump signs. Outside the funeral home he owns, a pro-Clinton sign was defaced with a “Hillary for Prison” sticker. “People are tense,” said Scott. The election hardened an already-clear racial divide in the former industrial city of 60,000 people - a snapshot of America at about 75 percent white and 18 percent black. Interviews with residents suggested its northern areas, mostly affluent and white, would vote for Trump, while its mostly black, lower-income southern section would largely support Clinton. “There is a division in this town, economically and racial. And we saw that in this election,” said Bob Leath, 58, owner of Buckeye PC Repair who voted for Trump to “clean house” in Washington. “If you voted for Clinton, you were most likely either young, lower-income or from the south side of the area.” For some, the tensions reach the bedroom. Sam Nail, a Cincinnati marriage counselor, said he has two couples who cited the election season as a “stressor” in their relationship. Much of the anger gets uncorked on social media and will be hard to undo. Some is well publicized. National Review writer David French has written about “an unending torrent of abuse” he and his family faced online from white nationalist Trump supporters, including a Tweeted image of his 7-year-old daughter’s face in a gas chamber. Others are less well known, like Brenda Thomas’ tangles with her older brother on Facebook. She says her brother unleashed a daily stream of Facebook posts on Clinton and President Barack Obama that she found objectionable. She said when her husband, a Republican, tried to reason with him, he was “unfriended” on Facebook. “I feel that I have to walk on eggshells with him and it causes problems at family functions,” said Thomas, 63, of Elizabethtown, Kentucky. In Charlotte, North Carolina, Karen Wilson, describes this election as “stressful” on Facebook. “I’ve got family members who are mad at me for deleting entire Facebook threads when I thought they were becoming too negative. I’ve deleted Facebook friends who I realized I never should have been friends with in the first place,” said Wilson, 43. Fourteen percent of respondents in the Reuters/Ipsos poll said they had blocked a family member or close friend from social media because of the election. For Democrats, this rises to 23 percent compared to 8 percent for Republicans. The divisions tore into the fabric of some communities. In Provo, Utah, Trump supporter Loy Brunson awoke on an October morning to find his car spray-painted with the words “AmeriKKKa” - a reference to “KKK” white supremacists - and “Fuck Trump.” His two Trump yard signs were destroyed. “So I doubled down, got motivated and put up 85 signs in my yard,” he said. Within days, all but six of those were stolen. “This was more than vandalism,” he said in an interview. “This was a free speech attack.” Some blame the divisiveness on campaign rhetoric that inflamed racial, ethnic and class tensions that have long simmered in America. Angry and extremist language moved into the mainstream. George Lakoff, a linguistics professor at University of California, Berkeley, blames Trump’s use of language, which he ranks as among the most violent of any candidate in modern times. He specifically notes Trump’s suggestion in August that gun rights activists could take matters into their own hands if Clinton defeated him, as well as the New York businessman’s comments that she should go to prison. “When you have extremes of that order, you have extremes of anger, extremes of fear,” Lakoff said. In Mississippi, Chad Scott, an activist in the Clay County Republican Party, fears a post-election split between the party’s working-class Trump supporters and business-minded elites - a sentiment echoed in Maine, where Foster, the Ellsworth resident at odds with his sisters, witnessed the election’s political vitriol first hand. Foster’s van was one of 20 vehicles spray-painted outside a Trump rally on Oct. 15 in the city of Bangor. And across Ellsworth, pro-Trump yard signs were stolen almost as fast as they were planted, Republican officials say. Foster worries about the divisions ahead. “My sisters will forgive me for my political views,” he said. “But the country is going to be on fire.”",1,fakenewsnet,,'Go to hell!'

"Donald Trump s spokeswoman Katrina Pierson went on national television to try and validate and justify Trump s comments about Muslims hating Americans. This time however, she was schooled by Muslim journalist Dean Obeidallah.During the interview, Pierson labeled the culture of Islam as the problem and referenced polls in some Muslim countries that showed a distaste for America. However, Obeidallah pointed out that her information is misleading because Indonesia, which is the largest Muslim country in the world, has a more favorable view of the United States than Germany and if a Muslim country has an unfavorable view of America, it s because of U.S. foreign policy and not some congenital hatred for the United States.For example, Pierson cited that polls show that the Palestinian Territories, the majority of whose inhabitants are Muslim, have an unfavorable view of the United States. While this is true, it s because when Palestinian civilians are tear gassed, gunned down in the streets, or bombed from the air, it s with US made weapons it gives to Israel. If the Palestinians were majority Christian or Jewish, they would still have an unfavorable view of the United States.Watch Here:[youtube also fired back at Pierson and Trump s idiocy by pointing to Trump s business dealings in Muslim countries. He said: Let s be honest. Donald Trump says here in America, Islam hates us. Then he goes to Dubai and does multi-million dollar business deals. Donald Trump loves Muslims when he s making money with them. He loves you when he s making money and demonizes you when he s getting votes. He s a despicable hypocrite. A special kind of hypocrite. There are many more proud and capable Muslim Americans like Dean Obeidallah in the united States and it would be great if we continue to see them on national television to rip apart the racists in our midst.

"Just two weeks after Republicans officially named Donald Trump as their nominee, they are already discussing how to replace him. Every day, his campaign becomes even more of a disaster. Hell, on just Tuesday afternoon he managed to enrage the GOP by refusing to endorse Paul Ryan and John McCain in their bids for reelection, continually insulted the family of a deceased soldier, made a huge joke of the Purple Heart, and kicked a crying baby out of one of his campaign rallies.According to Jon Karl, the chief White House correspondent for ABC News, GOP officials are now worrying that Trump may drop out of the race and are trying to figure out how to go about replacing him if he should decide to quit. Karl reported: This is absolutely unprecedented. First of all, I am told RNC chairman Reince Priebus is furious, that he has had multiple discussions with Trump telling him he needs to drastically change course. But here s the news, I am told senior officials at the party are actively exploring what would happen if Trump dropped out, how to replace him on the ballot. Karl noted that Trump cannot be forced out now that he has been officially named as the party s nominee, but he could solve the problem for them by dropping out all on his own. He would have to go out voluntarily, then it would be the 168 members of the RNC, through a complicated process, that would pick a new candidate, Karl said. It would have to happen by early September. George Stephanopoulos, host of Good Morning America, was stunned and asked if that was actually a possibility. Karl responded: He is so unpredictable right now, they are so unable to control his message, that they just don t know and clearly think it is a possibility, which is why they re looking at these rules. Regardless, the big-mouthed billionaire has managed to stay withing shouting distance of Hillary Clinton, which has caused the GOP to become even more enraged at his constant blunders. Karl continued: I have to say the frustration is especially deep because they believe that Hillary Clinton looks vulnerable, exactly as (ABC News political analyst) Matthew (Dowd) said, and had a bad few days, the DNC has gone through a whole shake-up. She misstated what that director said about her emails. One top official told me if Trump had gone on vacation for the past two weeks, he would be in the lead. But, yes, he can still raise money and still has support among the Republican rank-and-file. The GOP is shaking in their boots now, and with good reason.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - After days of chaos at airports and confusion over details of President Donald Trump’s immigration executive order, some of his fellow Republicans joined Democrats in saying Congress might need to consider legislation to address his new policies. Republican Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said it was too early to know all the implications of Trump’s order banning travel into the United States by citizens of seven majority-Muslim nations, but lawmakers might eventually need to step in to modify it. “Seriously, we still don’t know all the implications of what happened. I don’t think they (the Trump administration) know all the implications of what happened,” he told reporters at the U.S. Capitol. “There may well need to be a legislative fix.” Under the executive order Trump released on Friday, travelers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen may not enter the United States for at least 90 days while Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and others determine whether there is enough information available to screen them. Democrats in both the Senate and House of Representatives have introduced bills to rescind Trump’s order, but those measures are not expected to go anywhere in the Republican-led Congress. Senator John McCain, the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has criticized the order, saying it could weaken U.S. counterterrorism efforts. He blasted barring Iraqis who risked their lives to work as interpreters for U.S. forces, who have already undergone extensive screening. McCain and Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen led a push to pass legislation last year to provide visas to those Iraqis. McCain said he thought Iraq should not be on Trump’s list. He said it could invite retaliation by Baghdad and said that Iraq should not be lumped in with frequent U.S. nemesis Iran. “There’s no comparison. There’s thousands of Americans fighting in Iraq as we speak. And what if the Iraqis decided, OK, we’re not going to let all these contractors (working with U.S. forces) ... have visas to come into our country?” McCain asked. Iraq’s prime minister on Tuesday said the country would not retaliate to Trump’s travel ban against Iraqi nationals because it did not want to lose Washington’s cooperation in the war on Islamic State. McCain said whether legislation was needed would depend on how the executive order was implemented over time. “Let’s see what they do,” McCain said. “General Kelly today made some very significant changes to what was initially publicized. So let’s see what they do.”",1,fakenewsnet,,Trump immigration order may require legislation: U.S. lawmakers

"LAHORE, Pakistan (Reuters) - Pakistani opposition leader Imran Khan s party said on Monday it had built momentum in a by-election for ousted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif s parliamentary seat, despite finishing second, but the biggest inroads were made by two new Islamist groupings. Sharif s wife Kulsoom won the by-election with 49.3 percent of the vote in the eastern city of Lahore - a handsome margin of victory but down from the 61 percent garnered by the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party in the constituency in an election in 2013. The vote was seen as a barometer of support for Nawaz in the wake of his disqualification by the Supreme Court in July, and an indication of whether the corruption allegations leveled at the Sharif family have had an impact in their power base in the vast Punjab province. A general election is due next year. The election commission s preliminary results released on Monday showed that the candidate of Khan s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party took 37.6 percent of the vote, up from 35 percent in the last poll. Shah Mehmood Qureshi, the PTI deputy chairman, said the shrinking of the PML-N s winning margin from 26 percentage points to about 12 in a constituency where it has been so dominant showed its vulnerability in closer-run races in Punjab in 2018. If this happens in one of the strongest constituencies of PML-N, the prime minister s constituency which they ve had since 1985 That means there is a surge for PTI, there is a tilt for PTI, said Qureshi. PTI candidate Yasmin Rashid, a gynaecologist from the area, on Monday disputed the count and filed a petition with the electoral commission to suspend the results. We will continue our struggle for verification of the controversial votes which played an important role in the PML-N victory, Rashid said. It was two candidates backed by religious parties that appeared to most chip away at PML-N s vote share, however, together winning about 11 percent. Neither party - one of which is linked to U.S.-designated terrorist Hafiz Saeed - existed in 2013. Analysts say the by-election result will certainly concern Sharif s party. The committed and hardline vote did not shift from PML-N, but others who are not hard core or are somewhat independent, they seem to have shifted, said Hasan Askari, a political analyst. PTI officials are betting that corruption trials against Nawaz and his family due to start before the next poll, likely in mid-2018, will further erode support for the veteran leader who has served three stints as prime minister. Nawaz denies any wrongdoing and his family have alleged a conspiracy led to the Supreme Court disqualifying him for not declaring a small source of income, which he denies receiving. Nawaz s daughter Maryam, who spearheaded the campaign as her mother is receiving cancer treatment in London, had framed the by-election as a chance for voters to reject the Supreme Court s verdict against her father, and late on Sunday suggested some PML-N workers had been threatened and abducted. Maryam did not name anyone, but PML-N sources said she was accusing elements of the military establishment. The military has not commented on Maryam s remarks. PML-N officials tout Kulsoom s victory as proof that Nawaz remains popular with voters and say the closer margin is largely due to the strong showing by the two candidates backed by religious parties. One of the surprises of Monday s official results was the third-place finish of Shaikh Azhar Hussain Rizvi, an independent candidate backed by Tehreek-i-Labaik, a coalition of Islamist groups. The Labaik-backed candidate won 6 percent of the vote campaigning on a platform of support for Pakistan s strict blasphemy laws. His campaign posters praised executed killer Mumtaz Qadri, a bodyguard who assassinated Punjab s governor for suggesting the laws might be reviewed. After his execution, Qadri was hailed by some religious sects as a martyr for Islam. Yaqoob Sheikh, who was himself designated a terrorist by the United States in 2012, captured nearly 5 percent of the vote. Sheikh is backed by the new Milli Muslim League (MML) party that is loyal to Hafiz Saeed, who Washington accuses of being the mastermind behind the 2008 attacks in Mumbai that killed 166 people. A retired general and analysts have said that the MML - which has yet to be legally recognized, forcing Sheikh to appear on the ballot as an independent - was likely part of a mainstreaming project envisioned by the military to draw some militant groups into politics. The MML on Monday said it planned to contest another by-election in the northwestern city of Peshawar next month. Despite their relatively strong gains, neither the MML nor the Tehreek-i-Labaik is seen as having much chance of winning many seats in 2018.

"DUBAI (Reuters) - Bahrain s top Shi ite Muslim cleric underwent surgery on Friday, activists said, after he was hospitalized following months under virtual house arrest. News of Ayatollah Isa Qassim s fragile health has stoked tension in Bahrain as the Sunni Muslim-led monarchy pursues a crackdown on dissent by majority Shi ites. The leading Shia cleric was transferred this morning at 7:30 am to Ibn al-Nafees Hospital to undergo urgent surgery, the London-based Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (BIRD) said in a statement. Upon his arrival, he went into surgery and he is expecting further operations. Qassim, who is believed to be in his 70s, was suffering constant pain and excreting blood, citing a groin hernia, diabetes and a form of heart disease, the group said on Nov 27. The Interior Ministry said in June 2016 that Qassim s citizenship had been revoked, accusing him of trying to divide Bahraini society, encourage youths to violate the constitution and promote a sectarian environment in the Gulf Arab state. The decision sparked angry protests in Bahrain and drew sharp condemnation from regional Shi ite power Iran and statements of concern from the United States and Britain. In May, five people were killed when security forces raided Qassim s homevillage to disperse followers. The Sunni-ruled kingdom where the U.S. Fifth Fleet is based has pursued a crackdown on members of the Shi ite community since, with Saudi help, it quashed 2011 Arab Spring protests calling for more rights and representation. Authorities have closed opposition political groupings, revoked dissidents passports and arrested suspected militants accused of being backed by its arch-foe, Shi ite Iran.",1,fakenewsnet,,"Bahrain's Shi'ite spiritual leader undergoes surgery, activists say"

"SIMI VALLEY, Calif. (Reuters) - U.S. Central Intelligence Agency Director Mike Pompeo said on Saturday he sent a letter to Iranian Major General Qassem Soleimani and Iranian leaders expressing concern regarding Iran s increasingly threatening behavior in Iraq. Speaking during a panel at the annual Reagan National Defense Forum in Southern California, Pompeo said he sent the letter after the senior Iranian military commander had indicated that forces under his control might attack U.S. forces in Iraq. He did not specify the date. What we were communicating to him in that letter was that we will hold he and Iran accountable for any attacks on American interests in Iraq by forces that are under their control, Pompeo told the panel. We wanted to make sure he and the leadership in Iran understood that in a way that was crystal clear. Soleimani, who is the commander of foreign operations for Iran s elite Revolutionary Guards, refused to open the letter, according to Pompeo, who took over the CIA in January. Iranian media earlier quoted Mohammad Mohammadi Golpayegani, a senior aide to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, as saying an unnamed CIA contact had tried to give a letter to Soleimani when he was in the Syrian town of Albu Kamal in November during the fighting against Islamic State. I will not take your letter nor read it and I have nothing to say to these people, Golpayegani quoted Soleimani as saying, according to the semi-official news agency Fars. Reuters reported in October that Soleimani had repeatedly warned Kurdish leaders in northern Iraq to withdraw from the oil city of Kirkuk or face an onslaught by Iraqi forces and allied Iranian-backed fighters, and had traveled to Iraq s Kurdistan region to meet Kurdish leaders. The presence of Soleimani on the frontlines highlights Tehran s heavy sway over policy in Iraq, and comes as Shi ite Iran seeks to win a proxy war in the Middle East with its regional rival and U.S. ally, Sunni Saudi Arabia. A U.S.-led coalition has been fighting Islamic State in Iraq and Syria and is often in proximity to Iran-allied militia fighting Isis there. You need to only look to the past few weeks and the efforts of the Iranians to exert influence now in Northern Iraq in addition to other places in Iraq to see that Iranian efforts to be the hegemonic power throughout the Middle East continues to increase, Pompeo said. The CIA chief said Saudi Arabia had grown more willing to share intelligence with other Middle Eastern nations regarding Iran and Islamist extremism. The Israeli government said last month that Israel had covert contacts with Saudi Arabia amid common concerns over Iran, a first disclosure by a senior official from either country of long-rumored secret dealings. We ve seen them work with the Israelis to push back against terrorism throughout the Middle East, to the extent we can continue to develop those relationships and work alongside them - the Gulf states and broader Middle East will likely be more secure, said Pompeo.",1,fakenewsnet,,CIA chief Pompeo says he warned Iran's Soleimani over Iraq aggression

It s almost admirable. Craig Mazin February 7, 2016Mazin is my new hero. He was absolutely hilarious, and he was spot-on so many times. The New Hampshire debate was filled with so much bullsh*t it was hard to wade through it all. I literally screamed at my television several times, and at least twice it was Cruz who turned me into a demon. In one statement, the Iowa Caucus winner told the crowd that he did not believe that waterboarding fit the definition of torture. Seriously, he doesn t believe that putting a mask on someone and pouring water on their face to simulate drowning is torture. He doesn t believe that making someone think they are going to die over and over and over again is wrong. I guess that means he d be totally cool with a foreign government doing it to our citizens then? The second thing he said that really pissed me off was when he brought up his sister dying of a drug overdose. Wait, no. I m sorry his half-sister who died of a drug overdose. You see, he began his monologue about her horrible death by referring to her as his sister, but then he quickly corrected himself and made sure everyone knew that they had different mothers. So, he was exploiting her death, but also trying to distance himself from it. Pretty f*cking despicable. The rest of the candidates had the same kind of night. Unlike the other yellfests you could almost feel the desperation of candidates like Ben Carson and Jeb Bush who failed so miserably in Iowa. No matter how bad it was, though, Craig Mazin definitely provided us with some much-needed comedic relief. I hope he shows up for the next debate.

The ongoing controversy over Trump s behavior and comments have helped to damage his already failing campaign.

While a slight majority of men back Trump, Clinton s advantage with women has consistently been 11% and higher, even before the latest round of revelations.In addition to rejecting his current behavior, women responding to the pollsters have said that his dismissive attitude towards them has contributed to Clinton s support.The poll drop also comes as Trump spent days attacking former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, in what was seen as a continuation of his fat-shaming of her in the 1990s.Featured image via screen capture",0,fakenewsnet,, Trump Stooge: Women Making Assault Claims Are Too UGLY To Be Believed (VIDEO)

So when my own son is going through what he goes through coming back, I can certainly relate with other families who kind of feel these ramifications of PTSD and some of the woundedness that our soldiers do return with, and it makes me realize more than ever, it is now or never for the sake of America s finest that we ll have that commander-in-chief who will respect them and honor them. She s more than implying that President Obama doesn t currently respect our troops, which is just an outright lie. And it is also not the president s fault if her son may suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Nor was it his fault her son was arrested. Knowing this, and calling Sarah Palin out for this uncalled for and vicious attack, is the head of the New York City-based veteran s organization Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA). Paul Rieckhoff said: It s not President Obama s fault that Sarah Palin s son has PTSD. PTSD is a very serious problem, a complicated mental health injury and I would be extremely reluctant to blame any one person in particular. Also stating: It s important to recognize that Track may need help like many veterans. This is a great opportunity for Sarah Palin to sound the alarm about PTSD. Now that she has endorsed Mr. Trump, I would encourage her to talk with him about it. Mr. Trump s campaign is pretty light on specifics about what he would do for veterans. Adding: I hope this doesn t become a political chew toy in a political campaign. Reickhoff seems to really hope that Palin chooses to discontinue her efforts of politicizing PTSD. Hopefully, Palin can recognize that she is a public figure and can use her position in politics to not just become famous, but rather promote positive change in the lives of veterans nationwide. Outright blaming the president for PTSD is petty and wrong, and thankfully she was called out on it.Featured image: Gage Skidmore (flickr)",0,fakenewsnet,, These Veterans Have Some VERY Choice Words For Palin Blaming Obama For Her Son’s Behavior
"AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Transgender activists and business leaders urged a Texas Senate panel on Friday to scrap legislation that would limit bathroom access for transgender people, saying it was a discriminatory measure that would hurt the state’s economy. More than 250 civil rights activists, executives and others registered to speak to the Republican-dominated Senate as it began consideration of the measure, the most closely watched item on the state’s agenda during a 30-day special session. So-called “bathroom bills” have become a flashpoint of U.S. culture wars, with social conservatives saying they protect public safety and civil rights activists saying the measures allow government-sanctioned bias against transgender people. Ashley Smith, a transgender woman and San Antonio architect, said transgender women suffer more violence than the general public, and a bathroom bill would make her more fearful. “Can’t you see how this legislation would make the very real problem of assault even worse?” she asked members of the Senate Committee on State Affairs. Smith drew wide notice on the internet this week after posting a picture of herself with Republican Governor Greg Abbott, a supporter of the bathroom measure who she suggested had no idea she was transgender. Talk of the bathroom bill has already led to about $66 million in lost convention business, convention officials from Texas’ top cities told the committee. If the measure is enacted, the state could lose about $1.4 billion from lost conventions, sports contests and other events, they said. The main measure under consideration is Senate Bill 3, which says certain restrooms, showers and changing facilities in places such as public schools “must be designated for and used only by persons of the same sex as stated on a person’s birth certificate.” Supporters were few in number on Friday. The bill’s sponsor, Republican Senator Lois Kolkhorst, said SB 3 was about “about much more than bathrooms. “(It) is about finding a balance between the right to declare your gender and the right of a parent to protect their child,” she said. During the regular session that ended in May, the Texas Senate easily passed such a measure. But it died in the state’s House of Representatives under pressure from pro-business Republicans. Political analysts expect a similar pattern for the special session. A similar law in North Carolina, partially repealed in March, prompted the relocation of major sporting events and economic boycotts that were estimated to have cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars.",1,fakenewsnet,,"Activists, executives tell Texas Senate to ditch bathroom bill"

"When former FBI director James Comey refused to testify before Congress in a closed session, it seemed odd to many who have been paying attention to the Donald Trump/Russia scandal. Comey was fired shortly after requesting more funding for the investigation into Trump and his associates likely collusion with Russia. In Comey s termination letter, Donald Trump thanked him for confirming three times that he was not under investigation though Comey s colleagues say no such thing happened.According to numerous reports, Comey had begun receiving daily rather than weekly reports on the investigation in the time before he was fired. So why was he unwilling to testify? Because he wants this shit to go down in public.One of Comey s associates strategically leaked to the New York Times that Comey would be willing to speak :Mr. Comey made no comment, but later in the day he declined a request to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday. According to a close associate of Mr. Comey, he is willing to testify, but wants it to be in public.The matter arose in a series of early-morning Twitter messages in which Mr. Trump appeared agitated over news reports on contradictory accounts of his decision to fire Mr. Comey, which came at the same time the F.B.I. is investigating ties between Mr. Trump s associates and Russia. Among other things, he threatened to cancel future White House briefings.The White House s original version of the story was that the president had acted on the recommendation of the attorney general and deputy attorney general and fired Mr. Comey because of his handling of last year s investigation into Hillary Clinton s emails. But in an interview with NBC News on Thursday, Mr. Trump said he had already decided to fire Mr. Comey and would have done so regardless of any recommendation. He also indicated that he was thinking about the Russia investigation when he decided.What does Comey know? Trump, who demanded a loyalty pledge multiple times that the ousted director turned down, recently threatened to release tapes of their conversations. Trump did not say what was on these alleged tapes, but The Donald s Nixonian outburst reveals that he s incredibly nervous about whatever it is that Comey knows.As for Comey? He hopes there are tapes.A source close to Comey told me this morning: He hopes there are tapes. That would be perfect.

"If Republicans had hoped to escape 2016 without pulling a Todd Akin and costing themselves yet another election over idiotic abortion comments, they just lost it.In Missouri, a contentious fight over giving personhood rights to fetuses (and therefore legally defining abortion as murder), has given rise to one of the most horrific pro-life arguments made so far. Tila Hubrect, a state representative arguing in favor of fetal personhood claimed that abortion should be outlawed even in cases of rape because getting pregnant is the silver lining of the bad situation.Her comments were captured by Progress Missouri:It is not up to us to say no, just because there was a rape, they cannot exist. Sometimes bad things happen horrible things but sometimes God can give us a silver lining through the birth of a child.Many conservative pro-lifers think it, Hubrect just said it out loud: Women are baby factories and if they happen to get pregnant while being raped, then look on the bright side.The sickening conclusion is that women should be given absolutely no choice in who they conceive with.Missouri s Republicans are currently trying to make that conclusion fully realized with a particularly egregious pro-life bill that would define personhood at the moment of conception. This would allow fetuses to be given due process and possibly assigned state lawyers to file suits against their mothers if they tried to seek an abortion. Taken to its logical conclusion (which the Supreme Court would certainly take issue with), women could be held accountable for murder if they were to exercise their right to an abortion.Rep. Jay Barnes (R) recently bragged to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that this bill would make Missouri the most pro-life state in the country over night. He and people like Hubrect aren t messing around.Even in conservative Missouri, however, there seems to be limits to how far people are willing to let lawmakers control their bodies. Coincidentally or not, Missouri is also the home of former Rep. Todd Akin, who infamously floated the bogus theory that if there is a legitimate rape then the female body has ways to shut down her uterus and avoid a pregnancy. Akin went on to get positively demolished in his election to Democrat Claire McCaskill.It seems likely that Hubrect, perhaps overly giddy at the implications of this bill, may have just given her fellow Republican lawmakers a lot of heartache on Election Day.Listen to Hubrect s comments below:Featured image via LinkedIn",0,fakenewsnet,," Missouri Republican Calls Getting Pregnant The ‘Silver Lining’ Of Rape, Pushes Abortion Ban"

"Trump fanboy Newt Gingrich thinks that the best way to root out terrorists and potential terrorists in the U.S. is to take us back to the days of the Red Scare and McCarthyism, and create a new House Un-American Activities Committee. Speaking on Fox & Friends (because of course), he said: We passed several laws in 1938 and 1939 to go after Nazis and we made it illegal to help the Nazis. We re going to presently have to go take the similar steps here. Pssst Newt it was Nazis and communists, and then they went solely after suspected communists for decades after that, often ruining innocent people s lives in the process.The House Un-American Activities Committee was possibly the most un-American government body ever dreamed up. They relentlessly went after anyone in the general population they suspected of being a communist, or of having communist ties, issued subpoenas to those people, and then grilled them for hours on end. They asked about a suspect s political beliefs and activities, and to give them the names of others who might have been involved in subversive activities.Failure to comply meant getting sent to prison for contempt of Congress. Victims of the committee would also lose their jobs, and their employers would blacklist them, making it impossible for them to get another job once they were out of prison.In short, the House Un-American Activities Committee was engaged in a decades-long witch hunt.And that is what Newt Gingrich wants to bring back. Oh, sure, it s all for the safety of the country, so nobody should really object, right? Wrong. He d change his tune real quick if he were pulled in front of just such a committee and then saw his life ruined for it.

"One of the hallmarks about Jeb Bush s failing presidential campaign has been just how pathetic it has turned out to be. His latest campaign ad won t help that perception of the Republican once spoken about as a shoo-in for the nomination.The ad features Jeb Bush s mother, Barbara Bush, and she takes a swipe at Donald Trump.The former first lady says Jeb Bush wants to be president for the right reasons, unlike some other candidates in the field. Rather than talking about how popular they are or how great they are, he s doing it because he sees a huge need and it s not being filled by anybody, Mrs. Bush says, likely referring to Trump, the GOP front-runner.After months of being depicted as out of touch and a wimp, it probably won t help to have your mother now fight your battles for you. It s an approach that is sure to attract the derision of Donald Trump and other, more pugilistic Republicans.It has been startling how the Bush campaign and its affiliated super PAC has made so many mistakes throughout their campaign. Starting with a candidate with very strong name recognition and a $100 million-plus war chest that reportedly scared off a campaign from Mitt Romney, by this point Bush was supposed to be on the verge of accepting the nomination.Instead, he is polling in single digits, behind Trump and Cruz. He s served as the poster boy for the impotent Republican establishment, while his super PAC has been lighting money on fire on things like nonsensical ads making fun of Marco Rubio s boots.Bush himself has been a dud of a candidate, leading some to comment on how his brother and father seem to have had far more natural political talent. Bush has been awkward on the campaign trail, showing quirks more often associated with a political rookie rather than someone elected to govern in a populous state like Florida.Featured image via YouTube",0,fakenewsnet,, Pathetic: Jeb Bush Gets His Mommy To Take On Bully Donald Trump (VIDEO)

"BERLIN (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama and European leaders on Friday underscored the importance of working together in NATO and chided Russia for its bombing of Syria and failure to implement a Ukrainian peace accord. The White House statement followed a meeting at which Obama sought to reassure his counterparts from Germany, Britain, Spain, Italy and France that his successor Donald Trump would not break up the transatlantic alliance. Trump raised concerns during the campaign when he said he could withhold military aid from NATO allies if they had not met their defense commitments and said he would forge closer ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin. “President Obama expressed confidence that, even at a moment of great change, democratic values have done more to advance human freedom and progress than any other system in history, and will continue to do so going forward,” the White House said. The leaders agreed on the need to work together to stabilize the Middle East and North Africa, as well as securing diplomatic resolutions for the conflicts in Syria and eastern Ukraine. European leaders had sought Obama’s support as they prepare to extend sanctions imposed on Russia by Washington and Brussels in 2014 following its intervention in eastern Ukraine, and consider fresh sanctions over Russia’s actions in Syria, where it backs Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. German Chancellor Angela Merkel told a news conference with Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy that no decisions had been made about extending the Ukraine sanctions, but actions to implement the Minsk peace accord were not sufficient. Merkel said the leaders discussed their concerns about Syria during their meeting on Friday, but did not talk about imposing Syria-related sanctions against Russia that have been sought by the Syrian opposition. Obama and the EU leaders called for an immediate end to attacks on rebel-held parts of the city of Aleppo by Syrian government forces and their allies Russia and Iran that monitoring groups say have killed dozens this week alone. Syrian opposition officials on Friday met EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini and other officials and urged them to focus on protecting civilians and lifting the siege, said Anas al-Abdah, who heads the Syrian National Coalition. He said he had hoped for stronger words from Obama and the EU leaders, and called for Washington and Brussels to put more “real pressure” on Russia and Iran. U.S. and EU officials have stressed the need for a political solution, including the departure of Assad, but Trump has said he views the fight against Islamic State as a bigger priority. EU leaders are expected to extend sanctions related to Ukraine in December or January. Obama and the European leaders “unanimously agreed on the continued need for Russia to fully meet its commitments under the Minsk agreements and that Ukraine-related sanctions against Russia must remain in place until it does so,” the White House said. They said a durable ceasefire in eastern Ukraine was needed to move forward with free and fair local elections in the occupied regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.",1,fakenewsnet,,"Obama, EU leaders agree to stick together, stay tough on Russia"

"With Trump in the White House, former CBS Evening News anchor Dan Rather has an awful lot to say, probably because he s been around the political block a couple thousand times, and Trump is a dangerous buffoon, the likes of which we ve never seen. He doesn t comment on everything, and he apparently didn t want to comment on Trump s idea that Andrew Jackson was angry about the Civil War. But he sees something in that absurdity that he felt he needed to point out.According to his Facebook post on the topic, the sheer craziness of this obsession by Donald Trump with Andrew Jackson and the Civil War is a carnival act unlike anything I have ever seen at the White House. These are the rantings of someone who really should be focused on the job of governing. Should we not conclude that he approaches policy decisions with the same half-baked conspiracies with which he apparently approaches history? Trump, at the very least, has been approaching his presidency with the grand level of ignorance with which he approaches history. He recently told Reuters that he didn t think being the president would be so hard. He also said that nobody knew healthcare could be so complicated.Sure, Trump. The only people who did know are, well, pretty much everyone with the most basic understanding of our current political situation.That isn t all Rather blasted Trump about. He also dropped this truth bomb, with hell of a burn at the end, on Trump: To be President of the United States is to part of the great American story.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives nominated Speaker Paul Ryan on Tuesday for re-election to his post next year, as lawmakers giddy with election success smoothed over their differences and pledged to unite behind Republican President-elect Donald Trump. Ryan, who faced no challengers from Republican ranks, was nominated in a unanimous voice vote in a closed-door meeting of all Republican lawmakers in the House. He will face an election in January, when all members of the new House, both majority Republicans and minority Democrats, vote on a new speaker. While January’s outcome is not guaranteed, Republicans who had been feuding with each other and Trump before the election said Tuesday they thought Ryan was in a solid position to be re-elected speaker now that intra-party tensions have dramatically lessened with the Republican election victory. “Politics is politics, but this is as unified as I’ve ever seen it,” said New York Republican Representative Peter King, who has been in Congress since 1993. Republicans kept their majorities in both the House and Senate in the Nov. 8 elections in which voters elected Trump to the White House over Democrat Hillary Clinton. Ryan, 46, had criticized Trump numerous times during the campaign, which angered some of Trump’s supporters in the Republican caucus. Had Trump lost the election, these Republicans and some conservatives who already had doubts about Ryan might have sought to blame him and block his re-election. But lawmakers said Trump’s election, along with a stronger-than-expected performance at the polls by House Republicans, changed the outlook. “To suggest that President-elect Trump’s victory didn’t weigh as a factor in terms of the speaker’s race would be disingenuous” said Representative Mark Meadows, a member of the conservative Freedom Caucus. However, one conservative lawmaker, Representative Raul Labrador, continued to express skepticism about Ryan ahead of Tuesday’s vote, and said he would not consider Tuesday’s outcome binding on his vote in January. “I haven’t heard from him what he wants to change — what’s going to be different the next two years than the last two years?” Labrador asked reporters. Ryan, for his part, said House Republicans would be working “hand in glove” with Trump. “We’re going to do everything we can to help him be as successful as he can,” Ryan told reporters ahead of Tuesday’s vote. Republicans also re-elected three other lawmakers to leadership positions: House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, House Republican Whip Steve Scalise, and the chairwoman of the Republican conference, Cathy McMorris Rodgers.",1,fakenewsnet,,House Speaker Paul Ryan renominated to top House post
"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Wednesday that U.S. President Donald Trump’s travel restrictions on people with passports from seven countries and a freeze on refugee resettlement was “not the best way to protect the U.S.” and should be lifted sooner than later. Guterres’ comments were his first to directly address Trump’s signing of an executive order last Friday on immigration amid a drumbeat of criticism from around the world and protests. The order put a 120-day halt on the U.S. refugee program, barred Syrian refugees indefinitely and imposed a 90-day suspension on people from seven predominantly Muslim countries - Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The White House has described the order as necessary “to protect the American people from terrorist attacks by foreign nationals admitted to the United States.” But Guterres told reporters on Wednesday that “this is not the way to best protect the U.S. or any other country in relation to the serious concerns that exist about possible terrorist infiltration. “I think that these measures should be removed sooner rather than later,” said Guterres, who has issued a series of comments since Friday about the importance of protecting refugees and the dangers of broad-based travel bans. Guterres said travel bans risked playing to the advantage of terrorist organizations seeking to recruit members. “If a global terrorist organization will try to attack any country like the United States, they will probably not come with people with passports from those countries that are hot spots of conflict today,” he said. He said such groups were likely to use people for attacks traveling on the passports of “developed and credible countries,” or who had been living in the United States or other countries for decades. A panel of U.N. human rights experts urged the Trump administration on Wednesday to protect people fleeing war and persecution, and said the executive order contravened international humanitarian and human rights laws.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s administration is set to unveil revised self-driving vehicle guidelines next week in Michigan, responding to automakers’ calls for elimination of legal barriers to putting autonomous vehicles on the road, sources briefed on the matter said on Tuesday. U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao was expected to unveil the revised guidelines next Tuesday at a self-driving vehicle testing facility in Ann Arbor, Michigan, four people briefed on the matter said. A spokesman for Chao did not immediately comment. The White House Office of Management and Budget approved the undisclosed Transportation Department changes to the guidelines on Aug. 31, according a posting on a government website. On Wednesday, the U.S. House of Representatives will vote on a sweeping proposal to speed deployment of self-driving cars without human controls and bar states from blocking autonomous vehicles. The measure could help many automakers and tech companies keep their pledges of getting self-driving cars on the market by 2020 or 2021. The House will vote on the bill under fast-track rules that allow no amendments. A bipartisan group of U.S. senators working on similar legislation has not introduced a bill. The bill, passed unanimously by a House panel in July, would allow automakers to obtain exemptions to deploy up to 25,000 vehicles without meeting existing auto safety standards in the first year. Over three years, the cap would rise to 100,000 vehicles annually. The House measure would require automakers to provide regulators with safety assessment reports proposed in the 2016 self-driving guidelines, but would not require pre-market approval of advanced vehicle technologies. Consumer advocates have called for giving the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration quicker access to crash data and more funding to oversee self-driving cars. Automakers and technology companies, including General Motors Coand Alphabet Inc’s self-driving unit Waymo, have sought easier federal rules for self-driving technology, while some consumer groups have pushed for more safeguards. The Obama administration issued guidelines for self-driving cars in September 2016, calling on automakers to voluntarily submit details of self-driving vehicle systems in a 15-point “safety assessment” and urging states to defer to the federal government on most vehicle regulations. Automakers raised numerous concerns about the Obama administration guidance, including the suggestion that automakers should submit systems to regulators for review before putting them on the market. Companies including Waymo, GM, Ford Motor Co, Uber Technologies Inc, Tesla Inc and others are aggressively pursuing automated vehicle technologies.",1,fakenewsnet,,U.S. to unveil revised self-driving car guidelines: sources
"(In April 27 story, corrects name of Republican senator who has said he will not vote for the resolution to Bob Corker instead of Tom Cotton, paragraph 11) By Lisa Lambert and Sarah N. Lynch WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lawmakers, lobbyists and interest groups are making a final push in their fight over regulations enacted during former President Barack Obama’s last months in office, with the financial services industry working hard to kill a rule on retirement plans run by states. Using an obscure 1996 law known as the Congressional Review Act, Republicans have passed 13 resolutions killing Obama-era regulations on energy, the environment, gun control, education, family-planning funding and corruption. Once the rules are eliminated, agencies can never create “substantially similar” regulation. The deadline for introducing any new CRA resolutions on regulations enacted under Obama was nearly a month ago, and Republicans are working to complete resolutions already in the legislative pipeline before the third week of May. Currently, the resolutions only require simple majorities to pass both houses of Congress to reach President Donald Trump for signing. After May 11, they must win 60 votes in the Senate to pass, a steep hurdle, given voting margins on CRA resolutions have been tight and Vice President Mike Pence had to break a tie on one. A spokeswoman for Speaker Paul Ryan said the House of Representatives will probably not have any more CRA votes. A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said McConnell “has expressed interest in considering more” resolutions. The resolution on state-run retirement plans has been caught in limbo for weeks. Obama’s Labor Department had exempted both state and city-run retirement plans from the 1974 Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA, a law designed to protect workers’ savings with detailed compliance requirements. Private-sector workers whose employers do not offer 401(k) or other retirement benefits, and who often have low incomes, are automatically enrolled in plans being launched in some states, such as California and Illinois. States say the exemption lets employers pass workers’ money into plans without footing compliance costs. States are farther along than cities in establishing the programs, with cities still in the drafting stages. On March 30, the Senate approved a resolution already passed in the House killing the exemption for city programs. Trump signed it in mid-April. Voting on a near identical resolution on states’ programs was expected to follow immediately, but so far the measure has not come to the floor. Congressional aides say it has been hard to collect enough Republican votes to pass the measure. Republican Senator Bob Corker, of Tennessee, has stated that he will not vote for the resolution, and aides say Republican Senators Rand Paul, of Kentucky, and Todd Young, of Indiana, are also leaning to vote against it. The two senators’ offices did not respond to queries about their intentions. Lobbyists, though, are turning up the heat. In an April 27 letter, groups including the Investment Company Institute and U.S. Chamber of Congress wrote to all 100 U.S. senators urging them to repeal the state retirement plan rule, saying workers could be left unprotected.",1,fakenewsnet,,Republicans begin final push on killing Obama-era regulations

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence will seek on Saturday to soothe allies unnerved by his boss’ unorthodox statements on Russia and NATO as he stresses America’s commitment to Europe during the first major foreign address for the Trump administration. Pence will tell the annual Munich Security Conference that Europe is an “indispensable partner” for the United States, a message he will repeat privately in meetings with a dozen leaders over the weekend and on Monday, a senior White House foreign policy adviser told reporters. “We are the most secure and most prosperous when both the U.S. and Europe are strong and united,” the adviser said, previewing Pence’s trip. President Donald Trump alarmed allies during his campaign for office by breaking with traditional Republican views on the transatlantic relationship. Trump has expressed admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin, with whom he said he would like to work to fight Islamic State militants, and has questioned the value of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. In Munich, Pence will hold a series of meetings with leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, and leaders from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Pence will emphasize that Russia and Ukraine need to fully implement the Minsk ceasefire agreement, and will stand firm on economic sanctions on Russia related to its aggression in Ukraine, the adviser told reporters. He plans to discuss counterterrorism in a meeting with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, and the fight against Islamic State in meetings with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim, the adviser said. On Monday, Pence will hold several discussions with European officials in Brussels, including with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg. His trip comes amid turbulence at the White House. Trump fired his national security adviser on Monday for misleading Pence over his conversations with Russia’s ambassador to the United States. Trump was turned down by a replacement candidate on Thursday. While Pence’s sentiments may be welcomed, it may take more than soothing words to provide comfort, given the depth of anxiety in Europe about Trump’s foreign policy, said Derek Chollet, a top defense policy adviser to former President Barack Obama. “He will be trying to be reassuring, try to soften the edges of some of the president’s recent comments about Europe, put into context or explain - but I have to think that it’s not going to solve the problem,” said Chollet, now with the German Marshall Fund of the United States.",1,fakenewsnet,,Pence heads to Europe on reassurance tour
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate confirmed former Utah governor Jon Huntsman on Thursday to be President Donald Trump’s ambassador to Russia, sending an experienced diplomat to fill the crucial post in Moscow. The Senate confirmed Huntsman, who also served as ambassador to China under former Democratic President Barack Obama, by voice vote. Huntsman served as ambassador to Singapore under former Republican President George H.W. Bush. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee had approved Huntsman unanimously earlier this week, as members from both parties praised his qualifications and experience. The Senate also confirmed three other diplomatic positions by voice vote: John Bass, currently the U.S. ambassador to Turkey, to be envoy to Afghanistan; career diplomat Justin Siberell to be ambassador to Bahrain and Wess Mitchell, a think-tank founder, to be Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs. Huntsman takes on the post in Moscow as congressional committees and special counsel Robert Mueller investigate allegations that Russia sought to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election on Trump’s behalf, as well as potential collusion with Moscow by Trump associates. Moscow denies such activity and Trump dismisses any talk of collusion.

"WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland s president and its ruling party have reached a compromise on judicial reform, a parliamentary deputy said on Friday, bringing them closer to resolving an issue that has kept them at odds for more than three months. The government and President Andrzej Duda have been negotiating since July, when Duda unexpectedly vetoed legislation backed by the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party to overhaul the Polish court system. We ve reached a preliminary agreement ... I hope that in late November we could discuss the project in parliament, PiS parliamentary deputy and negotiator Stanislaw Piotrowicz said on Friday. The proposals vetoed by Duda would have immediately removed all current Supreme Court judges unless they had the approval of the justice minister. Parliament would have gained the right to name most of the National Council of the Judiciary, which would nominate future candidates to preside over the Supreme Court. By giving parliament effective control over appointing - and sacking - senior judges, the proposals raised alarms in the rest of the European Union, of which Poland is a member. The EU said they undermined the independence of the courts and threatened the rule of law. The proposed compromise would still give parliament the right to name members of the National Council of the Judiciary, but that would require a three-fifths majority in the lower house of parliament, Piotrowicz said. Opposition parties would gain the right to propose judges, too. If candidates failed to gain approval, they could be chosen by a simple majority, he said. The PiS says the judicial system needs to be reformed because the courts are slow, inefficient and steeped in a communist-era mentality. Duda s veto of parts of the reforms and his proposed limits on its authority over the court system created a stalemate that could have stalled the party s plans to reform not just the courts but the media and the electorate system as well. The compromise announced today still needs to be approved by the president and the leadership of PiS.",1,fakenewsnet,,"Poland's president, ruling party reach compromise on court reforms"

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A coalition of 14 conservative groups urged U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday to support an amendment to the House of Representatives’ annual defense bill that would prevent the Pentagon from implementing climate-change and green energy policies meant to save taxpayers money and protect the planet. In a letter to the lawmakers, the groups said many climate programs “are likely to undermine military readiness by diverting scarce resources.” The programs in question were initiated by former President Barack Obama’s 2015 executive order requiring the military to meet green energy and greenhouse gas emissions targets. The conservative groups are trying to gather support for Republican Representative Warren Davidson’s amendment to the House version of the National Defense Authorization Act that would stop the military from implementing the policies. The groups include the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian advocacy group; Americans for Prosperity, a group funded by the conservative Koch brothers; and Americans for Limited Government. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has long been supportive of programs that reduce troops’ petroleum dependence. In written testimony to a Senate panel after his confirmation hearing in January, Mattis said “climate change can be a driver of instability” and is “a challenge that requires a broader, whole-of-government response.” The House bill includes language from Democratic Representative Jim Langevin that would require the Pentagon to report to Congress on military bases that are most vulnerable from rising seas and other effects of climate change. It is uncertain whether Davidson’s or Langevin’s measures would be in the final House bill. The House is due to vote this week on its version of the defense bill and the Senate version will follow later this year. Myron Ebell, the head of global warming and international environmental policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, who also led President Donald Trump’s transition team for the Environmental Protection Agency, said in an interview that the Defense Department “needs to concentrate on its core mission and not waste a lot of time with irrelevant distractions that gain them some political cover.” When asked about Mattis’ position on climate, Ebell said he had heard generals say for years that climate change is a risk and “I’ve never listened to one who seemed to have the slightest clue as to what he was talking about.” The Defense Department, the largest U.S. consumer of energy, is planning to forge ahead with a decade-long effort to convert operations to green energy.",1,fakenewsnet,,Conservative groups urge lawmakers to gut climate programs in U.S. military

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has given immunity from prosecution to a State Department employee who helped set up and manage the private email server Hillary Clinton used for her work as secretary of state, the Washington Post reported on Wednesday. A senior U.S. law enforcement official said the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had secured the cooperation of Bryan Pagliano, who worked on Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign before joining the State Department with her and setting up the server in her New York home in 2009, the newspaper reported. (wapo.st/1RqkIk2) The Post described the investigation as a criminal inquiry, a label Clinton and her staff have resisted as they seek to reassure voters that the frontrunner to become the Democratic Party’s nominee in November’s presidential election is not in legal jeopardy. Clinton has said she did nothing wrong and that she believes the U.S. government will vindicate her. She has also apologized for what she said was poor judgment. In 2014, Clinton returned about 30,000 emails to the State Department, but said she “chose not to keep” thousands of others her staff deemed not to be work-related. Her staff have acknowledged that other work emails were not handed over, without explaining why. More than 2,000 of Clinton’s work emails contain classified information that could harm national security if exposed, according the State Department, including 22 classified as ‘top secret’, the highest level. The government forbids sending or storing classified emails through unsecured, non-government channels, and has prosecuted people for breaches. Brian Fallon, a Clinton spokesman, said in a statement that Clinton’s campaign was “pleased” that Pagliano was cooperating. The Justice Department and FBI declined to comment on whether Pagliano had been granted immunity, and his lawyer did not respond to questions. Last month, a federal judge overseeing a civil lawsuit against the State Department ruled that department officials and aides to Clinton could be questioned under oath about whether her use of a private email system was an effort to skirt open records laws. The FBI is likely to ask Clinton and her aides in coming months how the server was set up and whether they knew they were sending classified information in emails, the Post reported. Pagliano has declined to testify to lawmakers, citing a constitutional right against self-incrimination. Republicans have called for Clinton’s prosecution. “This terrible error in judgment coupled with Clinton’s arrogant and dishonest claims shows she can’t be trusted with the presidency,” Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee’s chairman, said in a statement.

"We all know the rules are a little different for the political class. But Michelle Obama s trips overseas hardly qualify as official business. They are lavish, extravagant, and excessive by any reasonable metric. Moreover, these latest revelations are hardly isolated.They are part of continuum reaching back across to the earliest days of the Obama administration. Recently, Judicial Watch obtained flight expense records from the U.S. Department of the Air Force revealing that Michelle Obama s June 2015 trip to the United Kingdom and Italy, accompanied by her daughters and mother, cost the taxpayers $240,495.67 in flight expenses alone.The records were released in response to a Freedom of Information (FOIA) request filed on June 22, 2015. The flights to London, England; and Milan, Venice, and Vicenza, Italy, for the June 15 21, 2015, trip totaled 20:35 hours at the cost of $11,684 per hour, bringing the flight expense total to $240,495.67, according to the Air Force documents.The Obama White House, true to form, tried spin the trip as a public service that was part of Michelle Obama s campaign to push her Let Girls Learn initiative and Let s Move anti-obesity campaign.Good grief. Everyone should deny themselves and streamline their lifestyles except for the Obamas.Press reports make it evident the Obama entourage set aside substantial time for tourism. In London, Michelle Obama joined Prince Harry for afternoon tea at Kensington Palace.And the White House press office conceded that, while in Italy, The First Lady will also visit cultural sites in Venice before returning to Washington, D.C. Judicial Watch released records revealing significant taxpayer-funded travel expenses for a Michelle Obama trip in July. Those records from the U.S. Department of the Air Force showed that Michelle Obama s 2014 trip to China cost American taxpayers $362,523.53 in travel expenses alone. Mrs. Obama, her daughters, and her mother spent March 19 26 in China, in a trip highlighted by extended visits to some of the country s most popular tourist sites.Apparently, the Obama family continues to bill the taxpayers for costly tourism jaunts thinly disguised as humanitarian crusades. If Michelle Obama wants to take tea with Prince Harry or enthuse over Da Vinci s The Last Supper, she is certainly entitled to do so, but not at taxpayer expense.Since the beginning of Barack Obama s administration, the Obamas have become increasingly notorious for unnecessary, luxurious travel, under the guise of official business.NewsmaxPresident Obama admitted he cried at a recent senior staff send-off dinner and is now claiming that he d be able to get re-elected if he had run for president again. I am confident in this vision because I m confident that if I had run again and articulated it, I think I could ve mobilized a majority of the American people to rally behind it, Obama said in a The Axe Files podcast interview by former aide David Axelrod. I know that in conversations that I ve had with people around the country, even some people who disagreed with me, they would say, The vision, the direction that you point towards is the right one, the outgoing president said.The Constitution limits a president to serving only two terms.Reflecting on his presidency, Obama said he s been inspired by the heart and idealism of his staff. We had our senior staff dinner I got through about four minutes of the thing and started getting the hanky out, he admitted.Obama said it feels like the band is breaking up, but that he wants to devote his post-presidency to growing the talent and vision that began in his two terms as president of the United States. Overall, this place never got cynical, he said, praising the many aides he s had over the years. We never had that fire snuffed out. That is a point of pride for me, he added.The podcast interview at times got personal, with Obama discussing his upbringing and talking about how his mom was a hippie. But she always insisted on shaving her legs, he told his former aide.The president also looked forward to leaving the White House, saying he s going to take his wife, Michelle, on a nice vacation because she deserves it.

"CARACAS, Venezuela (Reuters) - Venezuelan authorities overnight freed two activists who were in jail for more than a year after being accused of plotting against socialist President Nicolas Maduro, the opposition said on Saturday. Delson Guarate, who had been a mayor in central Aragua state, and former student leader Yon Goicoechea were among nearly 400 jailed anti-Maduro activists who rights campaigners say are political prisoners but whom the government calls coup-plotters. I m with my family today, tweeted Goicoechea, displaying a photo of himself against the backdrop of Caracas Avila mountain. Tomorrow I ll address the country. God is with us. I m free! Guarate tweeted. The pair s freedom, with some unspecified conditions attached, was confirmed by opposition parties and a rights group, but the government had no comment. The releases came as Maduro called for one of the most prominent opposition leaders, congress head Julio Borges, to face treason charges for lobbying against his government in global financial circles. And the pro-Maduro Supreme Court began moves this week to remove parliamentary immunity for congress deputy leader Freddy Guevara, so he can be tried for instigating violence. Guevara runs the militant Popular Will party, which both Goicoechea and Guarate belong to. It has been at the forefront of anti-Maduro protests, including four months of demonstrations this year that led to 125 deaths. Critics say Maduro has turned the OPEC nation into a dictatorship. His supporters say the 54-year-old successor to Hugo Chavez is resisting a Western-backed push to oust him. In a New York Times column earlier this year, Goicoechea described how a dozen policemen put a black cloth over his head when they arrested him before taking him to a cell without natural light or ventilation. When I stretched my arms, I could touch two opposite walls, he wrote in the column smuggled out of prison. The door was blocked with black garbage bags, leaving the room in total darkness. There was rotten, worm-infested food on the floor alongside scraps of clothing covered in feces. It felt as if I had been buried alive. Senior officials said Goicoechea was an imperialist agent caught with explosives in his possession, while Guarate had been financing terrorism. Neither was tried. Popular Will, which the government has threatened to proscribe as a terrorist organization, said it would not stop fighting for the freedom of all activists. The dictatorship s justice is a revolving door, said party legislator Juan Mejia.

"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The EU executive urged Spain to talk to Catalan separatists on Monday, condemning violence but also calling for unity, a day after Spanish police beat people trying to vote in an independence referendum in Catalonia. Edging into a minefield it has tried hard to avoid, despite a danger for stability in Spain and the euro zone, the European Commission issued a cautiously balanced statement. It voiced trust in Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy s ability to manage this internal matter , but also called for dialogue and reminded Madrid of a need to respect citizens basic rights. We call on all relevant players to now move very swiftly from confrontation to dialogue. Violence can never be an instrument in politics, the Commission said in a statement read out by chief spokesman Margaritis Schinas, just before Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont asked for EU mediation. Pressed by reporters, Schinas declined to say specifically that the EU was condemning Spanish police tactics, though it was their actions at polling stations on Sunday which mostly shocked fellow Europeans and generated public pressure that saw other governments including Germany and France call for more dialogue. Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker spoke to Rajoy later on Monday after being in contact over the weekend, though the EU spokesman declined to say whether the Union would mediate, an unusual step for Brussels to take within one of the bloc s own member states. Aides said Juncker spelled out the Commission position and was also in a listening mode . Donald Tusk, the former Polish prime minister who chairs summits of EU national leaders, said after his own conversation with Rajoy that he shared the Spanish premier s constitutional arguments but also appealed to him to find ways to prevent a further escalation and the use of force. The Commission statement also supported Madrid s line that the vote, which Catalan leaders said recorded a huge result for independence, was not legal under Spain s constitution. Brussels has in the past given little or no encouragement to separatist movements inside the European Union, whether those of the Catalans, Scots, Flemings or others. These are times for unity and stability, not divisiveness and fragmentation, it said. Any breakaway state would have to leave the EU and re-apply to join, the statement also noted. Even that could only happen if the split were amicable. This distinguishes Scotland, which held a referendum agreed with London in 2014, from Catalonia, where Spain s Constitutional Court has said the 1978 constitution forbids secession. For all the reluctance of other Europeans to be drawn into the dispute in public, there has been growing unease in Brussels about the way the conservative government in Madrid has handled the confrontation with Barcelona, reviving emotions rooted in 20th-century civil war and dictatorship. As pictures of heavily armoured Spanish police clubbing women on the ground stunned Europe on Sunday, the few governments that spoke out included those of Scotland, Slovenia, which emerged from the bloody collapse of Yugoslavia, and Belgium, where repeated rounds of devolution have averted a final split between French- and Dutch-speakers. On Monday, Berlin joined the calls for dialogue, warning against a spiral of escalation . Germany s BDI industrial federation warned that splitting the highly industrialised region from Spain would be very damaging for both sides.",1,fakenewsnet,,"EU urges Spain to talk to Catalans, condemns violence"
"MUNICH, Germany (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservative alliance should avoid making big policy commitments before they start coalition negotiations, potential junior government partners said on Thursday. Germany is set for months of uncertainty after Merkel s CDU/CSU alliance won a fourth term in Sunday s election but bled support to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). The Christian Social Union (CSU), Merkel s party s Bavarian ally, has signaled it wants a rightward shift, to focus on security and setting a limit on immigration numbers to dampen the appeal of the AfD, a policy firmly opposed by the Greens. This could complicate Merkel s hopes of building a three-way coalition between the conservatives, the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the pro-immigration, environmentalist Greens. Nobody should set out maximal demands that could already be seen as ruling it (such a coalition) out, Greens leader Cem Ozdemir told the Funke newspaper group. Merkel s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and will meet with the CSU on Oct. 8 to seek a common position ahead of negotiations with the other parties. The FDP also warned against making commitments that would undermine coalition prospects. Even if there s no guarantee of success, it would be wrong to pull down the shutters this early, party general secretary Nicola Beer told the RND newspaper alliance. Little movement on a coalition is expected before an Oct. 15 vote in the western state of Lower Saxony, currently ruled by the Social Democrats (SPD) - who have said they will go into opposition at the national level - and the Greens.

"IOWA CITY, Iowa/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The 2016 election is shaping up to be the year of angry voters, the disgruntled Americans shaking up the establishment by fueling the presidential campaigns of two very different candidates - billionaire businessman Donald Trump and self-declared socialist Bernie Sanders. Some 73 percent of voters likely to head to the polls in November’s election say they think the United States is on the wrong track, and these disaffected people make up a majority of the support bases for both Republican candidate Trump and Democratic hopeful Sanders - 87 percent and 54 percent, respectively, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll. Both candidates were seen as long shots against brand name rivals like Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton a few months ago, but have seen their popularity surge as the election race starts in earnest with the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 1. They are likely to do well in Iowa, but even if they lose, the fervor they’ve whipped up has upended the race and maybe even American politics. So who are the angry Americans? They deviate from the population in key ways: they are whiter, poorer and less educated. They are less likely to support a candidate who has been involved in politics. And regardless of party, they have deep distrust for Clinton after her more than two decades in the public eye. Where the camps differ is in identifying the root of America’s ills, with supporters of Sanders pointing to income inequality and health care as the top problems, and those backing Trump putting the blame on immigrants and foreign terrorists, according to the poll. Pundits have been quick to define the economy as the source of the voter anger feeding the Trump and Sanders campaigns. In a post-recession world, the middle class still struggles with stagnant wages and a weak job market. But a close look at the polls, and interviews with prospective voters, show concerns go well beyond economic indicators. Here in Iowa, the December jobs report issued Tuesday found just 3.4 percent unemployment – far below the national average and still on the decline. “Now Hiring” signs are ubiquitous across the state. Asked to select the top issue for the next president in the first 100 days of the new administration, 24 percent of voters nationwide who said the country was on the wrong track picked immigration - making it the most popular choice by that group. Only 10 percent of those who think the nation is on the right track selected immigration, making it the fifth most popular choice for that group, according to the poll. “Wrong track” voters were also more likely to say terrorism and the economy were concerns. Trump has built his campaign on an immigration platform that includes building a wall and deporting millions of undocumented immigrants. And his insistence that he could negotiate better trade deals provides a strong appeal to those concerned about disappearing jobs in a global economy. On Tuesday night in Iowa City, Trump’s rally drew both supporters and opponents. Eight times the event was interrupted by protesters, who were forced out of the packed gymnasium and heckled by the raucous crowd. Jim Schmidt, 48, of Johnson County, Iowa, was among the angry. His 11-year-old son wore a button proclaiming “Bomb the shit out of ISIS. The child watched as protesters were ejected from the event, cheering and waving his hand in support. “I’m angry but I love it and enjoy it,” Schmidt said afterward. He’s backing Trump for his business experience and ability to bring about change. Where Trump’s angry voters have been on display at rallies, the intensity around Sanders has manifested itself online - dominating message boards and comment sections. A liberal radio host in Oregon, Carl Wolfson, announced last month he was ending his show in part because of the vitriol coming from Sanders supporters. His Facebook post on the topic was then inundated with angry responses. Sanders is resonating among angry voters by focusing on income inequality, and promising to deliver universal health care and free college education. Meghan Metier, 22, of Iowa City said the Affordable Care Act - President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare reform - has allowed some of her friends to access Medicaid. But to keep it, she added, they have to be certain their income doesn’t exceed the poverty level, so they stay barely employed. For her the system is broken and Sanders is the only candidate who appears ready to fix it. “He’s a more reliable progressive,” she said, comparing him to Clinton.

"Apple s fight against the FBI on behalf of the privacy rights of their customers has taken a chilling turn, with law enforcement officers openly threatening to arrest CEO Tim Cook personally if his company denies their requests.Grady Judd, Sheriff of Polk County Florida, issued a threat of arrest to Apple CEO Tim Cook during a press conference on Sunday. Asked how he would respond if Apple (or any other telecommunications company) ever declines a request to hack a phone on behalf of law enforcement agencies, Judd gave an angry response: I can tell you, the first time we do have trouble getting into a cellphone, we re going to seek a court order from Apple.

"The connection between Donald Trump s presidential campaign and Vladimir Putin s government in Russia has been denied by the Republican nominee repeatedly. Despite praising him and at times defending his actions (like the annexation of Ukraine), Trump has rejected reporting and accusations linking him to the Russian strongman.But a new report from Mother Jones appears to shed new light on the Trump-Russia connection.In June, the former Western intelligence officer who spent almost two decades on Russian intelligence matters and who now works with a US firm that gathers information on Russia for corporate clients was assigned the task of researching Trump s dealings in Russia and elsewhere, according to the former spy and his associates in this American firm. This was for an opposition research project originally financed by a Republican client critical of the celebrity mogul. (Before the former spy was retained, the project s financing switched to a client allied with Democrats.) It started off as a fairly general inquiry, says the former spook, who asks not to be identified. But when he dug into Trump, he notes, he came across troubling information indicating connections between Trump and the Russian government. According to his sources, he says, there was an established exchange of information between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin of mutual benefit. The spy tells the magazine that the Trump-Putin exchange is an extraordinary situation. According to the report (reviewed by Mother Jones): Russian regime has been cultivating, supporting and assisting TRUMP for at least 5 years. Aim, endorsed by PUTIN, has been to encourage splits and divisions in western alliance. Trump s former manager Paul Manafort is currently the subject of an FBI inquiry, probing his connection to foreign governments associated with Putin. Manafort, a Republican fixer, worked on behalf of pro-Putin government forces while in Ukraine.At the same time as these connections have been uncovered and probe, Russian media has been amplifying revelations found in the email hack of Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta that have been published via WikiLeaks.U.S. intelligence agencies have tracked those hacking attacks back to Russian forces as well.Many roads in this election are leading to Russia.Featured image via Flickr",0,fakenewsnet,, Veteran Spy: Trump Trading Secret Info With Russians

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has pledged to raise taxes on the wealthy, preserve the Dodd-Frank financial reform law and provide a path to citizenship for undocumented workers. Here are the proposals the former secretary of state has made as part of her argument that she is best qualified to occupy the Oval Office: Clinton has said the rich, not the middle class, would see their taxes go up. She supports billionaire investor Warren Buffett’s eponymous tax proposal calling for those making more than $1 million a year to pay an effective tax rate of 30 percent. Clinton has also called for an additional 4 percent tax on those making more than $5 million annually. Clinton has pledged to raise the estate tax levied on property transferred from a deceased person to their heirs. She also supports a tiered inheritance tax structure, with a top rate of 65 percent on the wealthiest estates of more than $500 million for a single person or $1 billion for a couple. Clinton has pledged to unveil a plan to rebuild U.S. infrastructure during her first 100 days, saying this would create new jobs. She would use some of the revenue generated from her tax plan to pay for making community colleges tuition-free and ensuring students can graduate from public colleges and universities without incurring debt. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan, nonprofit group that independently scored Clinton’s proposals in their totality, estimated her policies would cost $1.8 trillion over the next decade and would be offset by $1.6 trillion, mostly generated by taxing high earners. The group said the remaining $200 billion could be covered by $275 billion in corporate tax revenue the Clinton campaign has called for but not yet spelled out in sufficient detail for them to credit as an offset at this time. Clinton has promised to propose broad legislation within her first 100 days in office to overhaul the immigration system and establish a process for undocumented workers to become citizens. Clinton has said she will defend executive actions taken by Democratic President Barack Obama to defer deportations of children brought illegally to the United States and the parents of children who are citizens or legal residents. She has said if Congress does not pass comprehensive immigration reform, she will similarly use executive action to defer deportations in “sympathetic cases.” A federal court has ruled that Obama did not have the authority to issue his executive orders on immigration, known as DACA and DAPA. The U.S. Supreme Court, currently short one member, split 4-to-4 on whether to hear the administration’s appeal, leaving the lower court’s ruling in place for the time being. Clinton has promised to preserve the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law enacted after the financial crisis, and to pursue further measures to toughen Wall Street regulations. She has proposed a fee for large financial institutions based on their size and the level of risk they pose. She would also give regulators additional authority to force institutions that pose high risks to break apart or reorganize. Clinton has also urged strengthening the Volcker Rule, which restricts proprietary trading by commercial banks. She has called for a new tax on high-frequency trading and for stricter oversight of hedge funds, private equity firms and other players in the so-called shadow-banking system. She has promised stiffer policies on people who commit financial crimes, including an extension of the statute of limitations on such crimes and a requirement for bank executives to return bonuses if their institutions suffer major losses. Changes to Dodd-Frank have stalled in the Republican-controlled Congress, and it is unclear whether Clinton could get congressional backing to strengthen the law, unless Democrats win control of one or both chambers in the Nov. 8 election. Clinton has pledged to defeat Islamic State and has said the first step to fighting the militant group is to eliminate its strongholds in Iraq and Syria. In a departure from the Obama administration, she supports the establishment of a no-fly zone over Syria and has called for an intensified air campaign by the U.S.-led coalition. Clinton has said she would send additional American special forces to help Arab and Kurdish forces already on the ground. She opposes sending additional U.S. ground troops to the region. Clinton has said the United States and European allies must share intelligence more effectively in order to thwart potential attacks. She has urged Silicon Valley companies to work with the government to track militant recruitment tactics on the internet. Current and former Obama administration officials have told Reuters they believe Clinton would take a harder line on Russia than either Obama or Trump. Clinton has said she believes Russian hackers are behind the breach of Democratic Party systems in an attempt to influence the U.S. presidential election. Clinton has said Russia should play a role in combating Islamic State in Syria, and her foreign policy adviser has said she would consider arming government forces in Ukraine, one of Russia’s neighbors, in a move to combat Russian “aggression in Europe.” Russia has backed ethic Russian separatists in Ukraine. Clinton was a key player in Obama’s “pivot” to Asia when she served as his secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. Clinton has said she will “aggressively pursue trade cases and impose consequences” against China when it commits trade abuses. She opposes granting China market-economy status, which China will be seeking when a World Trade Organization clause expires in December, and has said she would make sure a newly installed trade prosecutor would ensure that China is playing by the rules. Clinton has said she would treat cyber attacks from countries such as Russia and China “like any other attack” and that the United States “will be ready with serious political, economic and military responses.”",1,fakenewsnet,,"Factbox: Clinton's policies on economy, Islamic State, other issues"

He makes complete sense because he has lost confidence in the FBI director and he took the recommendation of Rob Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general who has been on the job for two weeks. Cooper then proceeded to grill Conway. That makes no sense, he fired back. He said one thing as candidate and now he s concerned as president? Clearly, this White House is under investigation, the people around the president are under investigation. You would agree with that, yes? In defiance of the facts, Conway disagreed and whined about people who are obsessed with Russia. Then she argued that since she s around Trump and not under investigation that others cannot be. I m around the president, Conway said. I m not under investigation. So that person doesn t exist anymore? Cooper asked. Candidate Donald Trump, that s a fictional character we are no longer allowed to refer to? We can only refer to the Donald Trump who exists today? Conway accused Cooper of being mean and claimed that Trump fired Comey because he needs confidence in his FBI director and he doesn t have it. Throughout the interview, Cooper can be seen reacting to Conway s most inane responses with facial expressions. At one point, he even rolled his eyes because of how ridiculous her answers were.Here s the video via YouTube.Clearly, CNN wasted their time and ours by inviting Conway on to spread Trump s propaganda. The only thing saving this interview is Copper s reactions to being gaslighted.The only reason why Trump fired Comey is because the FBI is investigating his Russia scandal. Trump just impeded that investigation and obstructed justice by firing the man in charge of it. Now Trump will likely put someone in charge who will drop the investigation. This is exactly the kid of shady shit that Richard Nixon did in order to cover-up his involvement in Watergate. He resigned rather than face impeachment. Trump should not only face impeachment, he should actually be impeached and put in prison.Featured Image: Screenshot",0,fakenewsnet,, WATCH: Kellyanne Conway Wore Out Her Welcome On CNN As Soon As She Opened Her Mouth

"After years of debate, the House on Thursday voted to repeal key parts of the Affordable Care Act and replace them with new provisions.The vote, which President Donald Trump was planning to tout as a big victory, sends the Republican-sponsored bill to gut Obamacare to the Senate for consideration.But winning approval for the bill could be even more difficult in the Senate than it has been in the House, where Republican leaders struggled for nearly two months to wrangle enough votes in their caucus to secure its passage.The bill passed by a vote of 217 to 213. All 193 Democrats voting opposed the bill; they were joined by 20 Republicans voting no. A lot of us have waited seven years to case this vote, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said shortly before the voting began. Many of us are here because we pledged to cast this vote: to repeal and replace Obamacare. This bill delivers the promises we have made to the American people, Ryan said.House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., told MSNBC shortly before the vote began, We were elected to do this. After the vote, protesters outside the Capitol building yelled, Shame, shame! at members of Congress walking down the front steps. CNBCWashington Free Beacon One of the amendments, introduced by Rep. Tom MacArthur (R., N.J.), co-chair of the Tuesday Group, allows states to obtain a waiver from federal standards such as essential health benefits and community rating rules. This measure gained the support of House Freedom Caucus members, who said it will significantly lower health costs, even if it does not fully repeal Obamacare. The MacArthur amendment will grant states the ability to repeal cost driving aspects of Obamacare left in place under the original AHCA, said the House Freedom Caucus. While the revised version still does not fully repeal Obamacare, we are prepared to support it to keep our promise to the American people to lower health care costs. Another amendment, introduced by Rep. Fred Upton (R., Mich.) adds $8 billion to the Patient and State Stability Fund, which helps reduce premiums and out-of-pocket costs. This amendment would provide additional funding, $8 billion over five years, to ensure a strong safety net and reduce premiums, or other out-of-pocket costs, for those with preexisting conditions, said Upton.Following the amendment, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said that the White House supported the measure and that President Trump has been working to ensure that Americans have more affordable care. Overall the efforts that were made, and especially the effort this morning with congressmen Long and Upton, help bring more people into this effort and make it even a stronger bill, and ensure that Americans have a health care system that gets them the care that they need at a price that s affordable, Spicer said. The president has been on the phone constantly, Spicer said. I think we have made this an unbelievable bill and an unbelievable replacement for Obamacare, which is failing, and that s what we ve sought to do from the beginning.",0,fakenewsnet,,BREAKING NEWS: GOP Controlled House Votes To REPEAL Obamacare
"Jut when you didn t think the hosts on the Fox News channel couldn t get any more despicable, they do. On Tuesday s edition of Fox and Friends, the hosts of that silly show decided to take aim at a high school athlete who just happens to be transgender. They misgendered her and called her a boy, and also said that she was gender bending, and confused. The athlete is a track star at her high school, and instead of praising this brave young woman as they should have the hosts said that she was confusing kids who are already pretty confused in this culture. They went on to wonder: Are girls who identify as boys, are they going to be the running backs for the football is that going to work out well? How s that going to work out? Here is the transcript of the conversation, via Media Matters:STEVE DOOCY (CO-HOST): Laura, we talk about popular culture and society. How about this story this morning. There s a high school track athlete who was born male, identifies now as female LAURA INGRAHAM: No.DOOCY: Competed with the girls track team. And finished I think third at the state competition. I think we could have seen this coming. What do you make of this?INGRAHAM: Well, it s another first, right? We re all into firsts so that s a first. Then it will be the first field hockey player and pole vault star. Let me just say this, and Brian will love this story. I was in field hockey in Glastonbury, Connecticut. And at the end of the season one season we had the boys soccer team play us. We were ranked number one in the state so the boys decided they were going to pick up sticks, the soccer team and play against us. Well, sadly for us the boys, who have never played field hockey, creamed us, okay? They killed us. We were number one in the state. They were faster. They were stronger. And they I mean, it made me really mad, but they had better hand/eye coordination and never picked up a stick before. So is this fair to the other girls competing? I mean, I don t think it s really fair.BRIAN KILMEADE (CO-HOST): Of course it s not.INGRAHAM: And I think it s just more gender bending. This is gender bending this is the next frontier until there s another frontier that the you know, those who want to mix up the traditional social mores want to take us to. So it doesn t surprise me. It s not fair. Until parents make their views known, this is just going to keep getting worse.KILMEADE: Hey, Laura, in an environment where people are taking performance enhancing drugs to do better in sports you know we re going to be in the situation where, well, we d like to win our first state championship so let s let a few men excuse me, some boys play with the girls team and then take the controversy and also take the trophy.INGRAHAM: Hey Brian, do you think it will go the other way though? Are girls who identify as boys, are they going to be the running backs for the football is that going to work out well? How s that going to work out? Let s go the other direction and see how successful that works out. I mean it s just, I have no I really have KILMEADE: I just shrug my I don t know what to say.INGRAHAM: Well, it s only the current conversation, but remember we ll be on to the next issue and then the next and the next. This is a current litmus test. You re not a human being with real feelings and empathy unless you re cheering this on and bowing down to this new movement. Look, that s the way they want to frame it. It s up to the regular Americans to say, look, I m a good person. But I don t think this is fair and I think most people don t develop their understanding of their own, you know, sexuality until frankly later in life. You know, I think it s I think it s confusing kids who are already pretty confused in this culture.KILMEADE: I m confused, and I m a grown-up. Laura Ingraham, I pretty much have reached my maximum in maturity. Laura. Thanks so much.This is really just too much, even for the imbeciles at Fox and Friends. They can have their opinions, sure, no matter how absolutely ignorant they may be.

"Talk about throwing your own party under a bus. This Trump supporter literally said the GOP has rigged elections and that is supposed to prove that Hillary Clinton has rigged the 2016 Election.Roger Stone is one of Trump s biggest supporters and in defense of the Republican nominee s assertion that the 2016 Election is rigged in favor of Hillary he wrote a column for The Hill in an attempt to demonstrate that Trump is right to be concerned. Not only did it go badly, but the Republican Party must be totally pissed off about it.That s because Stone claimed that Wisconsin Republicans, under Reince Priebus s leadership, were successful at rigging five elections in the state to make sure things went their way. As someone with great sentimental attachment to the Republican Party, as I joined as the party of Goldwater, both parties have engaged in voting machine manipulation, Stone claimed before naming names. Nowhere in the country has this been more true than Wisconsin, where there are strong indications that Scott Walker and the Reince Priebus machine rigged as many as five elections including the defeat of a Walker recall election. Stone even accused Priebus of orchestrating Ted Cruz s victory over Trump in Wisconsin earlier this year:When the Trump vs. Cruz primary took place, the same pattern emerged again of a Marquette University poll showing a 20 point shift from Trump ahead by 10% to Trump behind by 10%, which was simply absurd. Shifts like that don t happen over brief intervals of time, absent a nuclear explosion. It didn t make any sense unless you knew what was going on was an instant replay of Walker s victories. The machine Priebus built was delivering for Cruz big time.In short, Trump s longtime ally just tried to prove that Hillary could rig the election by accusing Republicans of rigging five elections and a primary in Wisconsin.Of course, this doesn t prove Trump s accusation against Hillary. What it does do, however, is call into question the trustworthiness of Republicans. If Reince Priebus is capable of rigging elections in Wisconsin to the point where Republicans can win five of them he is definitely capable of rigging a national election to make sure Republicans gain absolute power even though all of the polls indicate that Trump is losing this election badly.Trump own man just kneecapped the GOP nominee s own claims by shifting the election rigging accusation to Republicans.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",0,fakenewsnet,, OOPS: Trump Supporter Argues Hillary Could Rig Election Because Republicans Do It All The Time

"You remember that one company that used to stuff your mailbox full of coasters installation discs every single goddamn day of the week, your only reprieve from the madness being Sunday? Well, America Online finally discovered what it takes to be relevant: apparently Mike Pence uses it.On Thursday, the Indianapolis Star revealed that not only did the Vice President use private email something for which Donald Trump s opponent, Hillary Clinton, was demonized but he conducted state business on an insecure, almost-forgotten service that was presumed dead long ago. Unlike Hillary Clinton s private email server, Pence s AOL account was hacked.Clinton was spotted on a flight from Boston to New York on Friday and a passenger managed to catch the very moment the former Secretary of State saw the USA Today headline about Pence s private email. The passenger sent the photo to friends via Snapchat, and one of them saved it to share with the Hillary just checking the daily news. ""Pence used personal email in office."" The irony is palpable. pic.twitter.com/oia1ARiZ0g Pere Noel March 3, 2017The what in the fuck? look on Hillary s face is priceless. It s OK, we know what she s going through. We watched the Right froth at the mouth over what Ted Cruz would call a nothingburger if Clinton was a Republican for what seems like forever.It is not against the law to use a private email in Indiana, but officials are expected to retain the exchanges to fulfill public records requests. Documents released via a records request shows us that Pence discussed national security and other matters with his top advisors via his private email, but an unspecified number were withheld because the state considers them confidential and too sensitive to release to the public. Once again, these are from an account that was hacked last summer. The Star notes that the scammer sent an email to his contacts claiming Pence and his wife were stranded in the Philippines and in urgent need of money. He responded not by increasing his security, but by creating a new AOL screen name.We will not be seeing calls to LOCK HIM UP from the Right, nor will we see GOP politicians calling for endless hearings and investigations. Normally, this would be fine but at this point there seems to be one set of rules for Democrats and one for Republicans in an administration that is easily outpacing even the accusations they leveled at Clinton.This photograph serves as a reminder of what Americans who knew better but decided that voting their conscience was more important than literally saving America from a despot and people who are too stupid to operate a fork without adult supervision yet figured out how to vote caused us to lose.

"OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada, under pressure from allies to boost its commitment to peacekeeping, will propose offering helicopters for use by U.N. forces in Mali and could later provide troops to work as trainers, two sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau s Liberal government, which came to power in 2015 and quickly promised to make 600 soldiers available for peace operations, last year said it would consider sending soldiers to Mali but has repeatedly put off a decision amid fears of casualties. The stalling has irritated other nations, which say it could harm Canada s efforts to win a seat on the Security Council. Canada is prepared to send six helicopters for use by the 10,000-strong U.N. force in Mali, which is helping deal with a militant threat, said the sources, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation. More than 80 members have been killed since 2013, making Mali the world s deadliest peacekeeping operation. Canada is hosting an international peacekeeping conference later this month and officials are preparing a special meeting on the sidelines to discuss the needs of the Mali mission, both in terms of providing troops and helping train local forces, the sources said. One option for Canada would be to send soldiers to act as trainers, a role they are already playing in northern Iraq, said one source. They could either be based in Mali or nearby nations. Although Ottawa has sent three separate fact-finding missions to the Mali region, Canadian officials said they have yet to take a final decision on whether to send troops. We realize there is growing impatience for a final decision, said a Canadian source familiar with government thinking. Defense Minister Harjit Sajjan told reporters that when it comes to peace support operations... we will make sure that we take our time to make a responsible decision. He declined to give further details. Defense experts said that given the scale of the Mali challenge, they doubted whether even 600 Canadian troops could make a difference on the front lines. A senior diplomat from a nation involved in peacekeeping said the Canadian government should have studied the Mali mission carefully before publicly discussing the possibility of sending troops. If soldiers start coming home in coffins, it s debatable whether Sajjan could give a coherent explanation of why Canada was there in the first place, said the diplomat.",1,fakenewsnet,,Canada to propose helicopters for U.N.

"LONDON (Reuters) - The trilateral meeting between Iran, Russia and Turkey in the Russian resort of Sochi this week was a right step, at the right time for stability in Syria, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani told Syrian counterpart Bashar al-Assad. Russia s Vladimir Putin won the backing of Turkey and Iran on Wednesday to host a Syrian peace congress, taking the central role in a major diplomatic push to finally end a civil war all but won by Assad. Sochi summit was a right step at the right time, Rouhani was quoted as saying by state news agency IRNA on Saturday in a phone call with Tehran s main regional ally. He said a national congress to hold face-to-face talks between government and opposition could be a step towards stability and security of Syria. Iran has signed large economic contracts with Syria, reaping what appear to be lucrative rewards for helping Assad in his fight against rebel groups and Islamic State militants. Tehran is ready to have an active role in reconstruction of Syria, Rouhani added. The chief commander of Iran s Revolutionary Guards, who has sent weapons and thousands of soldiers to Syria to prop up Assad s regime, also said on Thursday that their forces were ready to help rebuild Syria and bring about a lasting ceasefire there. Syria s six-year civil war has killed hundreds of thousands of people and forced millions to flee in the worst refugee crisis since World War Two. In a joint statement in Sochi, the three leaders called on the Syrian government and moderate opposition to participate constructively in the planned congress, to be held in the same city on a date they did not specify. Saudi Arabia, Iran s arch rival in the Middle East, also sponsored a meeting on Wednesday at a luxury hotel in Riyadh for the Syrian opposition groups. Regional tensions have risen in recent weeks between Sunni Muslim monarchy Saudi Arabia and Shi ite Iran. Saudi Crown Prince called the Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei the new Hitler of the Middle East in an interview with the New York Times published on Thursday. Israel also views Iran as the main threat in the region, and a cabinet minister said this month Israel has had covert contacts with Saudi Arabia. It is very odd that a regional country considers Iranian nation as its enemy and the Zionist regime as its friend, Rouhani told Assad in the call. The next round of U.N.-backed peace talks in Geneva aimed at ending the Syrian civil war will begin on Nov. 28.",1,fakenewsnet,,"Iran's Rouhani says Sochi summit 'right step, at right time' for Syria"

"MANILA (Reuters) - Most Filipinos believe only the poor are killed in their country s war on drugs, and want President Rodrigo Duterte to reveal the identity of alleged narcotics kingpins and charge them in court, a survey released on Monday showed. The survey of 1,200 Filipinos by Social Weather Stations (SWS) conducted late in June also showed public opinion was split over the validity of police accounts of operations against illegal drugs that resulted in deaths. More than 3,800 people have been killed during Duterte s 15-month-old crackdown, all during police operations. Human rights group say the death toll is much higher and the official figures overlook murders attributed to shadowy vigilantes. Some activists say unknown gunmen have collaborated with police to kill drug dealers and users. Police and the government vehemently reject those allegations and accuse critics of exaggerating the death toll for political gain. The high death toll in Duterte s fight against crime and drugs, a key election plank, has stoked international alarm, although domestic polls have shown Filipinos are largely supportive of the tough measures. The crackdown has come under heavy scrutiny of late, prompted largely by the police killing of a 17-year-old student on August 16. Two witnesses on Monday told a senate inquiry they saw police officers kill another teenager arrested earlier in the same area for robbery. In both teen killings, however, police said the victims had violently resisted arrest. A third teenager arrested with the second victim was found dead with 30 stab wounds in a province about a three-hour drive away from the capital. Duterte has several times brandished what he called a file on 6,000 alleged druglords at the center of the country s trade. In the SWS survey, 74 percent of respondents said they wanted him to make that list public. The survey also showed 60 percent agreed with the statement that only poor drug pushers were killed. Duterte, who enjoys huge support among working class Filipinos, has been angered by critics who characterized his campaign as a war against the poor. The survey also showed nearly half of respondents were undecided whether police were telling the truth when saying that drugs war deaths happened only when suspects refused to go quietly. Twenty-eight percent said the police were lying but a quarter believed they were being honest. The Philippines, extremely sensitive about foreign criticism of its drugs war, last week accused the West of bias, hypocrisy and interference after 39 nations, most of them European, expressed concern about the drug-related killings.",1,fakenewsnet,,"Most Filipinos believe drug war kills poor people only, survey shows"

"BOGOTA (Reuters) - Former Marxist FARC rebels who have chosen to join drug trafficking gangs instead of demobilizing will face the full power of Colombia s military, President Juan Manuel Santos said on Thursday, amid worries gangs will stymie security gains. More than 11,000 fighters and collaborators from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) handed over their weapons this year as part of a peace accord with the government to end more than five decades of war. The group has kept its initials in its reincarnation as a political party. But the country s ombudsman says some 800 former guerrillas did not demobilize, a figure in keeping with estimates of security sources and think tanks who put the number of dissident ex-FARC members as ranging between 700 and 1,000. FARC leaders have renounced the dissidents and emphasized that the group will move forward as a peaceful political party. We re going to throw everything at these dissidents, Santos told journalists. There will be no hesitation. Santos said the number of dissidents is below the 15 percent of fighters that he said usually refuse to demobilize when rebel groups lay down their arms after peace deals. Human rights groups and analysts have expressed worries that a lack of state presence in territory formerly occupied by the FARC is allowing the smaller National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrilla group and criminal gangs to battle for control of lucrative coca crops and illegal mining sites. Amnesty International said in a report on Thursday that despite a reduction in civilian deaths, the conflict rages on in several parts of the country because of the presence of the gangs and the ELN.",1,fakenewsnet,,FARC dissidents face full force of Colombia military: president

"When Donald Trump named Steve Bannon as his chief policy strategist, millions of Americans expressed outrage and fear because of Bannon s ties to white nationalists, who have been cheering about his appointment ever since it was announced.But now Bannon is giving Americans even more reason to be scared.During an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Bannon claimed that darkness is good and compared himself to Satan, Darth Vader and Dick Cheny. Darkness is good, Bannon said. Dick Cheney. Darth Vader. Satan. That s power. Satan is the evil ruler of Hell according to Christians, so Christians should probably start wondering if they put the anti-Christ in the White House.Darth Vader is a particularly bad choice to compare oneself to considering how much the Nazis influenced the themes and designs of Star Wars, including Vader s helmet, the Stormtroopers, and how democracy was turned over to a tyrant with applause.So it s definitely an eerie comparison that may be serving as a shout-out to neo-Nazis.And Dick Cheney is a war criminal who signed off on torture and lied us into two wars that cost thousands of American lives and trillions of dollars.Bannon claimed that he isn t a white nationalist but said that Trump s tenure in office will be as exciting as the 1930s. You know, that decade when the Great Depression raged and fascism rose to power in Europe which led to the most horrifying and destructive war in all of history? Yeah, that 1930s.And as if Bannon couldn t possibly say anything worse, he went on to say that he is the Thomas Cromwell of the Trump administration. I am Thomas Cromwell in the court of the Tudors, he said.Thomas Cromwell was the chief minister to King Henry VIII, a despotic ruler of England who executed two of his wives.Seriously, Bannon is not doing Trump a service with these comparisons. If anything, he just gave more reasons for people to call for his ouster. Why would anyone want to unite behind someone who has one of these evil people or characters as their chief adviser?

"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel tried to reassure municipal credit analysts on Wednesday that the city and its public school district are not falling into a financial abyss. “I will not rest until we fix the fiscal position of both the city and (Chicago Public Schools),” the mayor told the National Federation of Municipal Analysts annual conference. But some attendees said his speech did little to alleviate their worries about the city’s sinking credit. “I’m very concerned. I don’t see them making any headway,” said Susan Dushock, a senior vice president at SunTrust Private Wealth Management, referring to an ongoing political impasse that is hindering Chicago’s efforts. The battle between Illinois’ Republican governor, Bruce Rauner, and Democrats who control the legislature has left the state without a fiscal 2016 budget and has stymied Chicago’s efforts to seek pension relief. Chicago continues to struggle with a structural budget deficit and a $20 billion unfunded pension liability. Rulings by the Illinois Supreme Court both this year and last year have made it much more difficult to enact pension changes to lower that liability. Emanuel likened those rulings to putting “a straightjacket around us,” but vowed to continue negotiating with unions to reach a deal that ensures pensions are paid in a manner that is responsible to taxpayers. He also touted the diverse economy of the nation’s third-largest city, its ability to snag relocating corporations, and educational improvements at schools. “(Emanuel) didn’t focus on how to solve the current fiscal crisis,” said Richard Ciccarone, who heads Merritt Research Services. CPS is also betting on state solutions for escalating pension payments that have left it with a $1 billion budget gap. The district is calling for a bigger share of state funding to cover pensions and the costs of educating poor children. The city and CPS have been hit with downgrades that pushed their credit ratings closer to or into the “junk” level and both are paying a huge penalty in the U.S. municipal bond market. Chicago general obligation bonds due in 22 years were trading at 287 basis points over Municipal Market Data’s benchmark triple-A yield scale, while the so-called credit spread for CPS bonds due in 15 years was 463 basis points, according to MMD.",1,fakenewsnet,,Chicago mayor vows fiscal fix before muni audience

"Mississippi has been on a theocratic tear lately. When not giving churches the ability to create militias for God with the power to use deadly force and carry firearms, the state s largely conservative legislature has been busy attacking gay rights with something bordering on obsession.Mississippi s state Senate pushed through a vicious anti-gay bill that would:But if that wasn t enough, the bill also reinforced Mississippi s long-standing ban on same-sex couples from adopting children. The insane bigotry on display in Mississippi in the face of current trends towards LGBT rights has led to bizarre work arounds, including social workers asking same-sex couples to live in separate houses for at least six months so they could legally pretend to be single parents *wink wink* and not two loving ones who happen to be gay.A federal judge took one look at the case and concluded that Mississippi was violating a mountain of human rights.Written by U.S. District Judge Daniel Jordan III, the order argued that the state s law barring the adoptions obviously targets married gay couples and limits their rights. Furthermore, the court argued that the Department of Human Services policy violates the constitution s equal protection clause as the result of last year s landmark Supreme Court ruling that laws against same-sex marriage are unconstitutional.In short: You can t tell same-sex couples that they can t have children just because you don t happen to like same-sex marriage. It doesn t work that way.The fact of the matter is that Mississippi has absolutely no case other than unmitigated bigotry to justify its same-sex adoption ban. Study after study has shown that adopted children in same-sex households do just as well as their counterparts adopted by heterosexual parents. In one major study, researchers discovered that kids raised in same-sex households actually did better.In light of that research, preventing gay couples from adopting isn t just a major screw you to the potential parents, but also to the kids waiting in foster homes. Republican lawmakers may feel comfortable telling gay Mississippians that they aren t allowed to have children, but it takes a particularly heartless person to coldly explain to a child that they can t have a family because a few politicians in the Capitol find same-sex marriage icky. Thankfully, Judge Jordan s ruling isn t just good news for the people of Mississippi, but have far-reaching implications. As of now, the Department of Human Serves doesn t explicitly protect sexual orientation from adoption discrimination. Jordan called bullshit. According to his ruling, that policy is, in itself, discrimination and should be amended. That would mean Mississippi would be just the first of several Republican states to suddenly have their bigoted adoption policies dismantled.If it stands it means a lot of kids waiting for adoption are about to get some great news.Featured image via Wikipedia",0,fakenewsnet,, A Federal Judge Just Slapped Down One Of Mississippi’s Most Digustingly Bigoted Laws
"Republican nominee Donald Trump has finally made some decisions on a few of his Cabinet members if he wins the election tomorrow, and it s almost just as depressing as imagining him getting into the White House. Following the theme of giving the most offensive GOPers more power, Trump has decided that New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani deserves to be his Attorney General.When MSNBC reported on Trump s list of bigot helpers, host Tamron Hall could barely get the words out about Giuliani. When she tried to deliver the news about the former NYC mayor, she choked up and coughed, making it hard to actually complete her sentence. Hall said: New this morning, Trump campaign sources tell NBC News among those being considered to serve in a Trump administration. Rudy Giuliani for Attorney General, excuse me Hall tried to move on and talk about Newt Gingrinch being chosen as Trump s Secretary of State, but she was already coughing. She recovered quickly, perhaps putting the shock and disgust of Giuliani s new position on the back burner for now, and went through the rest of Trump s choices with zero issues.You can watch Hall get sick to her stomach over the Giuliani news below:Having Giuliani as a major help to Trump in the White House is terrifying. He s not only defended Trump s racism, misogyny and other offensive comments by the business mogul, but he s also been caught lying a fairly good amount. Giuliani is basically just like Trump, and giving both of these idiots more power is just about the worst decision that America could make in this election.

"Stephen Colbert delivered a scathing segment directed at Mylan executive Heather Bresch on Friday night, for raising the price of Epipens. During the segment, Colbert compared Bresch to Martin Shkreli, A.K.A Pharma Bro, the CEO responsible for raising the price of HIV medication by 5,000 percent.Early on in the segment, Colbert hilariously pretends to use one of the lifesaving Epipens, saying: That was a clone one. I am allergic to douche. The devices price jumped from $100 dollars a pair to $600 dollars a pair without any good reason for the cost increase other than increasing Mylan s profits.She s frustrated, Colbert said. I mean the tone-deafness of that just takes your breath away and getting your breath back will cost you over 600 bucks. Mylan has responded to widespread condemnation of the price hike, by essentially pretending to lower the cost of the medical device. However, it s actually a public relations move that doesn t actually do much to lower the cost at all.While CEOs such as Bresch and Shkreli have taken heat for artificially increasing the cost of medications, they are just following the overall trend in the pharmaceutical industry. A recent study found that the cost of prescription drugs have been skyrocketing for the past five years.Pharmaceutical companies can charge whatever they like for their medications. Other countries, such as Canada which has a national healthcare system, regulates such things. Which is why Canadians have not been subjected to the same price gouging for Epipens as people in the United States have been.Bresch and Shkreli are certainly douchebags who are worthy of Colbert and the public s mockery. However, they are just cogs in a machine that will continue to hum along until people demand real change in the United States healthcare system.You can watch the segment below, in full.Featured image via screen capture",0,fakenewsnet,, WATCH: Colbert Tears Mylan CEO Apart With This Brilliant Comparison

"SAN DIEGO (Reuters) - Donald Trump brought his message of walls and deportations to the doorstep of America’s busiest border crossing on Friday as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee greeted supporters in San Diego, amid one of the largest counter-protests organized against him. The scene inside the San Diego Convention Center during Trump’s speech was relatively placid, while outside demonstrators opposed to his controversy-ridden White House bid marched and chanted, carrying signs criticizing his rhetoric against illegal immigration. Waving U.S. and Mexican flags, more than 1,000 people turned out for anti-trump rallies in San Diego, a city on the U.S.-Mexico border whose San Ysidro port of entry sees nearly 300,000 people a day cross legally between the countries. San Diego is considered a binational city by many who live and work on opposite sides of the border, and about a third of the city’s population is Latino. During Trump’s speech on Friday, some protesters outside the convention center scaled a barrier and lobbed water bottles at police. One man was pulled off the wall and arrested as others were surrounded by fellow protesters and backed away from the confrontation. After the convention center emptied, clusters of Trump supporters and anti-Trump demonstrators began to mix in the streets, many exchanging shouted epithets and some throwing water bottles at one another. Police in riot gear declared the gathering an unlawful assembly and ordered the crowd to disperse, herding the crowd out of the city’s hotel and restaurant-filled Gaslamp Quarter. San Diego police said on Twitter that 35 arrests were made during the protest. No property damage or injuries were reported, police said. “Fantastic job on handling the thugs who tried to disrupt our very peaceful and well attended rally,” Trump tweeted to police afterwards. Trump has weathered months of blowback from all ends of the political spectrum for his immigration policy, which calls for the building of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and deporting the nearly 11 million undocumented immigrants who reside in the United States. Critics have said his plan is needlessly cruel and impossible to implement. At Trump’s campaign stops, attendees often chant “build the wall.” While Trump is running unopposed in the June 7 California Republican primary, his stance on border control and deportation seems unlikely to resonate with the electorate at large in a state where political fallout from a Republican-backed crackdown on illegal immigrants 20 years ago cost the party dearly. Friday was not the first time Trump has been greeted by civil unrest in California, which is home to the largest Latino population in the country. Late last month, a visit to the California Republican convention set off days of protests in the area, leading to several arrests. Shortly before taking the stage in San Diego, Trump issued a statement ruling out a one-on-one debate with second-place Democratic hopeful Bernie Sanders, who was also in California, killing off a potentially high-ratings television spectacle. The suggested debate, an idea first raised during a talk show appearance by the New York billionaire, would have sidelined likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton but given Sanders a huge platform ahead of California Democratic primary. A day after saying he would welcome a Sanders debate, Trump called the idea “inappropriate,” declaring that he should only face the Democrats’ final choice. “I will wait to debate the first-place finisher in the Democratic Party, probably Crooked Hillary Clinton,” Trump said in a statement. Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, expressed disappointment on Friday, and sought to goad Trump into reconsidering. “Well, Mr. Trump, what are you afraid of?” he said in a video clip posted on ABC News’ Twitter account. Trump suggested broadcast networks were unwilling to go along with his demand that at least $10 million raised from the encounter be donated to charity. “I’d love to debate Bernie,” he told a rally in Fresno, California. “But the networks want to keep the money for themselves.” Sanders is trailing Clinton in the race to secure their party’s nomination, but opinion polls show he is slicing into her lead in California. Clinton has shown no interest in debating Sanders before the California primary, which will be part of a final slate of nominating contests. It is possible she will clinch the nomination by winning New Jersey earlier that day, making the outcome in California superfluous. The former U.S. secretary of state has said she is looking forward to debating Trump later this year ahead of the Nov. 8 general election. Clinton leads Trump by 4 percentage points in the most recent Reuters/Ipsos poll. Democrats nationally remain evenly split between Clinton and Sanders.",1,fakenewsnet,,"Trump's San Diego rally draws more than 1,000 chanting protesters"
"There is no reason to believe the welfare of our veterans would be a priority for Obama after he leaves office, considering they were never a priority for the 8 years he occupied the White House.A charity group that helps homeless military veterans on Chicago s South Side says the city is trying to take control of the meager facility to make way for the restaurants, shops and other commercial venues that would complement the proposed Obama presidential library and museum.Group leaders said the RTW Veterans Center is the last privately-owned property on a stretch of S. King Boulevard near the proposed Washington Park site for the Barack Obama Presidential Center and that city building inspectors unexpectedly arrived last April to find an overwhelming 32 code violations at the facility. We don t appreciate being muscled out and put in the situation of having to negotiate from a position of despair, facility center Director Jah Ranu Menab told FoxNews.com on Saturday.Menab thinks the University of Chicago, which is working with the Obama Foundation to bring the presidential center to the South Side, is also part of an apparent effort to ultimately force the facility into receivership.The fate of the veterans facility which officials say serves more than 3,000 meals monthly may well be decided Tuesday, when officials return to Cook County Circuit Court for a hearing on the efforts to fix the building s problems.Menab admits that the facility is in disrepair, with some violations related to a fire hazard, rats nests and raw sewage flowing onto the basement floor.However, he says the situation, which includes fines of $16,000 daily, looks like an attempted land grab and that the prestigious university, where Obama was a law professor, exerts a tremendous amount of influence over the city and its future.The university strongly denies any involvement in the city s dealings with the center and its building and on Friday issued the following statement: The mission of providing support for veterans is extremely important, and numerous University of Chicago community members have volunteered their time at the RTW Veterans Center. The university is not engaged in discussions regarding the center s property and has no plans to purchase it. Veterans center co-founder Daniel Doc Habeel, a Vietnam War veteran, acknowledged Saturday that people associated with the university have indeed volunteered time. But he also expressed uncertainty about the university s involvement. The not-for-profit facility, which receives no government funding, cited in a press release Wednesday a history of building inspectors in other places forcing a worn-out building into receivership so a prospective developer is eventually able to acquire the property without having to negotiate. The city says the fines are not being enforced and that the case landed in court because numerous 311 calls led inspectors to visit the facility, where they learned about the severity of the problems, including a structurally unsafe porch.

"Who knew that presidenting would be so hard, right? Conservatives voted a former reality show star into power with zero experience in politics and they thought that would be a good thing. Donald Trump has always claimed to have a high IQ, even going as far as to offer to compare IQ tests with Rex Tillerson after reports surfaced that the secretary of State had called him a fucking moron. But we d really like that to happen because while Trump is on his 13-day trip overseas, he revealed to Japanese dignitaries that he didn t know how many countries there are in the world until he became the so-called president.First, Japanese Prime Minister Abe gave his remarks in front of the crowded room, then Trump got up to the mic to be sure to embarrass the U.S. again. So my relationship with Shinzo got off to quite a rocky start because I never ran for office, and here I am, Trump told the room. But I never ran, so I wasn t very experienced. And after I had won, everybody was calling me from all over the world. I never knew we had so many countries.

"Hmmm Ever wonder why the left fears Trump so much? The Daily Beast s Tim Mak and Brandon Zadrozny woke up on Tuesday to find that CNN completely embarrassed them. After publishing a more-than-1,700-word-long invective on Monday evening reprinting old and disproven allegations against GOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trump by his ex-wife in divorce proceedings Trump s ex-wife herself came out with a statement to CNN standing by her ex-husband, and discrediting the liberal outlet s hit piece which relied heavily on statements she made in divorce proceedings 30 years ago. I have recently read some comments attributed to me from nearly 30 years ago at a time of very high tension during my divorce from Donald. The story is totally without merit. Donald and I are the best of friends and together have raised three children that we love and are very proud of. I have nothing but fondness for Donald and wish him the best of luck on his campaign. Incidentally, I think he would make an incredible president, Ivana Trump, Donald s ex-wife, said in the statement to CNN.Donald and Ivana Trump had three children together Ivanka, Eric and Donald, Jr., Donald s oldest children and now all officials at Trump s company three of Trump s five children.The embarrassing and quick putdown of the Daily Beast story comes just hours after the outlet ran a blistering headline falsely accusing him of rape: Ex-Wife: Donald Trump Made Me Feel Violated During Sex. The sub-headline of the inaccurate article was even worse, directly leveling the false rape allegation: Ivana Trump once accused the real-estate tycoon of rape, although she later clarified: not in the criminal sense. The way they justified dredging up the three-decade-old allegation from divorce proceeding transcript, which was again per Ivana s statement to CNN clearly false? Donald Trump introduced his presidential campaign to the world with a slur against Mexican immigrants, accusing them of being rapists and bringing crime into the country. Mak and Zadrozny wrote as the lead of their article before delving into the lurid, old and disproven details. I mean somebody s doing it! Who s doing the raping? Donald Trump said, when asked to defend his characterization. It was an unfortunate turn of phrase for Trump in more ways than one. From there, they delve into the old allegations: Not only does the current frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination have a history of controversial remarks about sexual assault, but as it turns out, his ex-wife Ivana Trump once used rape to describe an incident between them in 1989. She later said she felt violated by the experience. The incident did come up in the divorce proceedings transcripts and was first reported on widely and publicly by former Texas Monthly and former Newsweek reporter Harry Hurt III in his 1993 book: Lost Tycoon: The Many Lives of Donald J. Trump. So, what did Mak and Zadrozny do?

According to CBS News: A week after an attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act failed, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says he d consider a bipartisan effort to continue payments to insurers to avert a costly rattling of health insurance markets.McConnell told reporters Saturday there is still a chance the Senate could revive the measure to repeal and replace Obamacare, but he acknowledged the window for that is rapidly closing. Everyone knows that the Obamacare repeal is hopeless. Americans are strongly against it, and nothing the Republican Party has put forward over the last few months has even been close to an alternative. Republicans are slowly becoming aware that a bipartisan bill might be their only chance to have some sort of impact on health care and if Congress approves a bipartisan bill with enough support to override a presidential veto, Trump will be forced to sign the bill whether he likes it or not.Trump s presidency looks more and more like a failure every single day. Even the members of his own party are ignoring him and moving away from his agenda. Trump isn t a president, he is a joke.Featured image is a screenshot",0,fakenewsnet,," Republicans Kill Trump’s Dream To Repeal Obamacare, Ready To Work With Democrats (DETAILS)"

"Conform or pay the ultimate price Police seized ten children from an off grid homeschool family in Kentucky on Wednesday after receiving an anonymous tip about the family s traditional lifestyle.The nightmare story began when sheriff s officers set up a blockade around Joe and Nicole Naugler s rural property before entering the premises. Eight of the kids were out with their father but Nicole and two of her oldest children were at home. Nicole attempted to drive away but was subsequently stopped and arrested for resisting (attempting to prevent officers from taking her two boys away).The sheriff then demanded Joe Naugler turn over the other eight children by 10am the next day or face felony charges, an order with which he complied. They are an extremely happy family, said family friend Pace Ellsworth, who asserts that the Nauglers were targeted because of their back to basics life and their decision to homeschool their children.Friends reported no concerns about how the children were being treated by the parents, who follow an educational model called unschooling where the children decide their own curriculum based on the subjects that interest them and what their strengths are. This is the natural way to live, said Ellsworth. It s actually a growing movement. They want to have a personal education and not a factory education. They are completely open about their life. Everyone is learning by living. They are all extremely intelligent. The family s Facebook page entitled My Blessed Little Homestead, is a charming testament to their way of life. The Naugler children are obviously living a blissful free range lifestyle amongst 26 acres of land in Breckinridge County. They frequently post pictures and videos of their children, animals and their off-grid life, reports Off the Grid News. A May 5 post showed a video of a toddler, Mosiah, learning to walk. An April 24 post showed a happy family, gathering around a campfire, roasting marshmallows. The family have set up a GoFundMe page to try and raise money for legal expenses.A website for the family spells out their plight with the heart-wrenching words; This Kentucky family of 12 people, 6 dogs, 2 farm cats and a few random farm animals was just torn apart. Their crime: Living a simple, back to basics life. This shocking story once again illustrates how families attempting to simply get on with their lives in a traditional manner are being treated as extremists by other Americans, snitched on, and targeted by authorities.Here is a Facebook link to the Nagger family business: Blessed Little Grooming Company, LLCVia: InfoWars",0,fakenewsnet,,FAMILY LIVING ‘TRADITIONAL LIFESTYLE’ TORN APART: POLICE SEIZE 10 Homeschooled “Off Grid” Children From Their Family

"LONDON (Reuters) - British lawmakers have written to Prime Minister Theresa May, urging her to challenge U.S. President Donald Trump on his views on climate change when the two leaders meet on Friday. Trump has dismissed climate change as a “hoax” and vowed during his presidential campaign to pull the United States out of the 2015 Paris Agreement designed to curb greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming. “As one of the world’s largest emitters ... his approach to reducing emissions could determine whether we, in the UK and people round the world, experience or avoid the worst impacts of climate change,” the letter from the cross-party Environmental Audit Committee said. May is set to be the first foreign leader to meet the new U.S. President on Friday, with the talks expected to focus on trade. Environmental Audit Committee chair Mary Creagh said that May should use the opportunity to demonstrate Britain’s commitment to fighting climate change. “The Prime Minister has said she won’t be afraid to challenge the new President. So she should start by telling him climate change is not ‘a hoax’,” Creagh said. Scientists warn that rising global temperatures must be stalled to stave off the worst effects of climate change, including floods, droughts and rising sea levels.",1,fakenewsnet,,British lawmakers urge May to tackle Trump on climate change

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. senators reached an agreement on Monday on legislation imposing new sanctions on Russia, including a provision that would prevent the White House from easing, suspending or ending sanctions without congressional approval. The agreement, to be filed as an amendment to an Iran sanctions bill, is intended to punish Russia over issues including its alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region and support for the government of Syria in that country’s six-year-long civil war. [L1N1J41LS] The Iran bill is due come up for a vote as soon as this week. Besides the provision setting up a process for Congress to review changes in sanctions, the measure would put into law sanctions previously established via presidential executive order, including some on certain Russian energy projects and debt financing in some industries. It would impose new sanctions on Russians found to be guilty of human rights abuses, supplying weapons to Syria’s government and conduct cyber attacks on behalf of Russia’s government, among others. The measure also would allow new sanctions on Russian mining, metals, shipping and railways. The legislation is backed by both Republicans and Democrats, and is expected to easily pass the Senate. It was introduced amid an intense focus in the U.S. capital on relations with Russia, and investigations by the Department of Justice and congressional committees of whether Russia sought to influence the 2016 U.S. elections to help elect Republican President Donald Trump, and whether Trump associates colluded with Moscow as it sought to influence the election. To become law, the legislation would have to pass the House of Representatives and be signed into law by Trump. If Trump objected, some of its backers said they expected enough congressional support to override a veto. “These additional sanctions will ... send a powerful and bipartisan statement to Russia and any other country who might try to interfere in our elections that they will be punished,” Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement. Russia has denied attempting to interfere in the U.S election, and Trump has dismissed any talk of collusion. The measure also authorizes “robust assistance” to strengthen democratic institutions and counter disinformation in European countries that might be targeted by what the legislation’s sponsors described as Russian aggression. In December, the final full month of President Barack Obama’s administration, Washington sanctioned Russian businessmen and companies for Moscow’s role in Ukraine via executive order.",1,fakenewsnet,,U.S. senators reach deal on Russia sanctions

"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The school collapse this week that killed at least 19 children during an earthquake has prompted many Mexicans to question whether building codes developed after a devastating 1985 temblor are too easily flouted. Stringent codes enacted after a massive temblor killed thousands three decades ago minimized damage this week across the metropolis of 20 million people, even if experts say it is nearly impossible to design structures to withstand any quake. At least 293 people died in Tuesday s quake, measuring 7.1 on the Richter scale, but the toll could have been far worse. Still, the collapse of some structures built under the new codes, including the Enrique Rebsamen school that became a symbol of this week s tragedy, has sparked concerns over implementation of the rules. There are still gaps that mean new buildings don t always fully comply, said Roberto Meli Piralla, a structural engineer and expert on seismic preparedness at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. It is too early to know if code violations, neglect or corruption were factors in the collapse of the school or about 50 other buildings in Mexico City. Yet engineers said that challenges remain in enforcing the codes uniformly and ensuring that builders, inspectors and property owners follow approved plans. Inspectors can be criminally liable if a building they OK proves structurally unsound. The mayor of the district where the school is located said her office has been unable to find documentation to assess its construction and structural history. She blamed problems, including corruption, on a predecessor administration. When we came into office, there were many files missing, said Claudia Sheinbaum, the mayor of the Tlalpan district. She said she had no proof that corruption had anything to do with the collapse. Before the quake, municipal officials were already discussing revisions to strengthen code oversight, said Piralla, who is part of an engineering group that made recommendations to the city in recent weeks. One suggestion, according to another engineer involved in the discussions, was to have an independent, third-party review of designs before inspectors sign off on them. The Secretariat for Housing and Urban Development, the municipal office that oversees the code, could not be reached for comment. Even if compliance were universal, engineers said, there is no way to fully prepare because earthquakes vary widely. Tuesday s temblor generated a different frequency of shockwave from the 1985 quake and toppled mid-sized buildings of roughly six to eight stories, compared with towers of about 12 to 15 floors in 1985. It s not possible to say what problems could have been foreseen, said Antonio Gallardo, a member of the board of architects in Mexico City, a council that upholds professional standards across the capital. Most of the damage on Tuesday happened in central and southern districts where soils are less solid than in northern neighborhoods, and urban development, even after improvements in recent decades, is still patchwork. Although the toppled buildings are still being investigated, some were built after the 1987 code, which has periodically been revised since. At the school, which is in southern Mexico City, the older of two structures remained standing while a newer building collapsed. It was built early last decade and opened in 2004, according to several people familiar with its history. The school is a private facility founded in the 1980s by the family that runs it, according to two adult former students. The principal, a daughter of the founders, lived in an apartment that was part of the collapsed structure. She survived the quake, current and former students said. Neither the principal nor other family members could be reached for comment. But local authorities, neighbors and parents are demanding answers. Who could have approved this school? asked Raul D az, a doctor whose 7-year-old son, Eduardo, died at the school. The building was poorly built. If prior quakes are any guide, investigations and a full accounting will take years. But experts said it would be impossible to build structures that could withstand all quakes. There is always going to be a degree of uncertainty, said Mary Comerio, a professor of architecture and researcher on disaster recovery at the University of California at Berkeley. She cited the 2011 earthquake that leveled even costly, modern structures in Christchurch, New Zealand. The extent of a phenomenon known as liquefaction, in which solid soil behaves like a liquid, surprised scientists. Notwithstanding architectural advances, many other variables come into play including human error, ground conditions, the location, depth and force of an earthquake. In 2006, Comerio authored a paper in the journal Science called Can Buildings Be Made Earthquake-Safe? The answer is largely no, she said.",1,fakenewsnet,,Mexico school collapse spurs doubts over building code for quakes

"BERLIN (Reuters) - Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore suggested on Tuesday that the presidency of Donald Trump could end prematurely for “ethical reasons,” drawing laughter from a packed movie theater at the European premiere of his latest film on climate change. “We’re only six months into the experiment with Trump. Some experiments are ended early for ethical reasons,” Gore said, acknowledging the “provocative” nature of his comment. Gore said he was convinced that U.S. cities, states and business executives would meet U.S. obligations under the 2015 Paris agreement to fight climate change, despite Trump’s decision in June to withdraw from the global pact. “We have a global agreement and the American people are part of this agreement in spite of Donald Trump,” he told hundreds of moviegoers at Berlin’s Zoo Palast cinema after a showing of his new film, “An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power.” “We can win this ... All we need is the political will,” he said, adding his hope that the United States would “soon once again” have a leader who was committed to halting global warming. The film argues that fighting climate change is a just, moral battle, on a par with social movements such as the civil rights movement in the United States or the fight for gay rights. Gore’s first documentary, “An Inconvenient Truth,” is credited with bringing climate change into mainstream political discourse in the United States a decade ago. Gore said he was confident the American and German people would remain united in their commitment to reversing the devastating effects of climate change already visible around the world on a daily basis. He said he was “heartsick” about Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris deal, but said it could trigger an even stronger commitment by other nations to reduce greenhouse gases as an act of defiance. He lauded Germany’s leadership in moving toward alternative energy sources, and said global moves to shift to solar and wind power would drive economic growth and create many new jobs. The U.S. State Department last week officially informed the United Nations that it would withdraw from the Paris deal, but left the door open to re-engaging if the terms improved for the United States. But, in a diplomatic cable, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told U.S. diplomats to sidestep questions from foreign governments on what it would take for the U.S. government to re-engage in the Paris climate deal, Reuters reported earlier on Tuesday.",1,fakenewsnet,,Al Gore says 'ethical reasons' could end Trump presidency early
"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European parliamentarians want Britain to end regrettable practices that discriminate against EU citizens in the workplace and elsewhere, a draft resolution published on Thursday showed. Lawmakers also urged British authorities to grant broad rights to EU citizens and their families in Britain after it exits the EU in 2019, an issue where EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said on Thursday big differences remained. The European Parliament expresses concern about regrettable administrative practices against EU citizens living in the United Kingdom , the draft resolution said. Lawmakers said there were also cases of British citizens discriminated against in other EU countries. The British government said on Sept. 9 that its Equalities Office (GEO) was aware of, and is looking into, reports of discrimination against non-UK EU nationals seeking employment in violation of the 2010 Equality Act. The document, agreed on Thursday by the leaders of the assembly s political parties, will be voted on by the chamber next week in Strasbourg. The document is not binding on EU negotiators but the 28-nation parliament has the right to veto any deal with Britain on its future relations with the EU. MPs also urged Britain to protect the rights of EU citizens and their children even if they are born there after Brexit. Future family members should continue to benefit from right of residence under the same provisions as current family members, the document said. EU lawmakers have opposed Britain s proposals to create a new category of settled status under United Kingdom immigration law for EU citizens. Differences on these issues remain, Barnier said on Thursday at the end of a fourth round of Brexit negotiations.

"(Reuters) - Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Wednesday called for surveillance of mosques as part of U.S. law enforcement efforts to prevent terrorism, and stood by his remarks on banning Muslim immigrants, which others in his party have criticized. Trump repeated his call for a temporary ban on the entry of Muslims into the United States after a U.S.-born Muslim, the son of Afghan immigrants, fatally shot 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando early on Sunday. The New York real estate developer said that while the Florida gunman was born in the United States, “his parents weren’t and his ideas weren’t born here.” “We have to maybe check, respectfully, the mosques and we have to check other places because this is a problem that, if we don’t solve it, it’s going to eat our country alive,” Trump said at a rally in Atlanta. Trump had called for surveillance of mosques in November, as well as a database of Syrian refugees entering the United States. The Orlando gunman, Omar Mateen, is believed by authorities to have acted alone, inspired by radical ideology he was exposed to over the internet. “Any kind of extremism and violence is not preached in American mosques,” said Ibrahim Hooper, communications director for the Council on American-Islamic Relations. “In fact, research has shown that mosques are a moderating influence on individuals who attend.” Prominent Republicans this week distanced themselves from Trump’s comments about Muslims. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on Tuesday he did not think a ban on the entry of Muslims was in U.S. interests. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who ran against Trump for the Republican nomination and has been a fierce critic since, said that he was “unnerved” by Trump’s response. Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, said on Wednesday that Trump’s rhetoric had grown “even more inflammatory” in recent days. She said the United States counts on Muslim communities in the U.S. and partners in majority-Muslim countries to help fight terrorism. “Not one of Donald Trump’s reckless ideas would have saved a single life in Orlando,” Clinton said at an event for U.S. military families in Virginia. Trump on Monday proposed that the United States suspend immigration from areas of the world where there is “a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies until we fully understand how to end these threats.” He also said radical Muslims were entering the country amid a flood of refugees and “trying to take over our children.” Trump’s hard-line proposals on immigration have contributed to his popularity among some conservative voters. But they have also triggered condemnation from minority and human rights activists and his political opponents, many of whom have called his rhetoric racist. The New York businessman also said in Atlanta he would meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un if he came to the United States, and he dismissed the controversy he caused in May when he said in a Reuters interview he would be willing to speak to Kim. “If he came here, I’d accept him. But I wouldn’t give a state dinner like we do for China and all these other people that rip us off,” Trump said.",1,fakenewsnet,,Trump backs surveillance of mosques despite criticism of rhetoric

That s because they used knives and a truck! Trump tweeted in regards to the attacks that took place in London over the weekend. Although seven people lost their lives and 50 more were wounded, Trump was more concerned with using the tragedy to push his pro-gun agenda.Do you notice we are not having a gun debate right now? That s because they used knives and a truck! Donald J. Trump June 4, 2017Giffords, who was herself a victim of gun violence, was not in the mood for Trump s bullsh*t. Mr. President, every day we are having a gun debate because every day 90 people in our country die from gun violence.

Gabrielle Giffords June 4, 2017Giffords became an advocate for the prevention of gun violence after she was shot and severely injured in a supermarket parking lot while meeting with constituents. Six others were fatally shot that day. She and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, founded Americans for Responsible Solutions, a nonprofit that seeks to prevent gun violence.Trump is not only a Republican, but he is also easily bought. He bows to the highest bidder and when it comes to guns, that would be the National Rifle Association. So it isn t surprising that he is pro-gun. But to exploit a terror attack just one day afterward, while the grief is still raw and the city of London is still reeling, is low even for Trump and the NRA.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images",0,fakenewsnet,, Gabby Giffords Drops Mic On Trump After He Exploits London Attacks To Push Pro-Gun Agenda

"Crooked Hillary has always been crooked. She s just been better than anyone America s ever seen at not getting caught On September 5, 2006, Eli Chomsky was an editor and staff writer for the Jewish Press, and Hillary Clinton was running for a shoo-in re-election as a U.S. senator. Her trip making the rounds of editorial boards brought her to Brooklyn to meet the editorial board of the Jewish Press.The tape was never released and has only been heard by the small handful of Jewish Press staffers in the room. According to Chomsky, his old-school audiocassette is the only existent copy and no one has heard it since 2006, until today when he played it for the Observer.The tape is 45 minutes and contains much that is no longer relevant, such as analysis of the re-election battle that Sen. Joe Lieberman was then facing in Connecticut. But a seemingly throwaway remark about elections in areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority has taken on new relevance amid persistent accusations in the presidential campaign by Clinton s Republican opponent Donald Trump that the current election is rigged. Speaking to the Jewish Press about the January 25, 2006, election for the second Palestinian Legislative Council (the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority), Clinton weighed in about the result, which was a resounding victory for Hamas (74 seats) over the U.S.-preferred Fatah (45 seats). I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake, said Sen. Clinton. And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win. Chomsky recalls being taken aback that anyone could support the idea offered by a national political leader, no less that the U.S. should be in the business of fixing foreign elections.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Rex Tillerson arrived in Bonn on Wednesday on his maiden foreign trip as U.S. secretary of state to attend a summit of G20 top economies at a time when many are wondering how far President Donald Trump’s “America First” message will reshape U.S. foreign policy. From North Korean provocations and reports Russia has deployed a new cruise missile, to concerns about China’s actions in the South China Sea and conflicts in Yemen, Syria and Ukraine, there is no shortage of global challenges. Tillerson did not make any remarks on his arrival in Bonn. Senior U.S. officials said Tillerson’s two-day trip was mostly to listen to what G20 counterparts had to say, conceding that this might frustrate some. Tillerson will also participate in a series of sessions on a shifting global order, cooperation with Africa and conflict prevention. It will be a prelude to the G20 leaders summit in Hamburg, Germany in July, which Trump is due to attend. “I think he is mostly going on a listening tour,” said a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity, saying that may disappoint U.S. allies. “If our (guy) says, ‘well, I am just here to listen,’ that’s going to be dispiriting.” U.S. allies worry about Trump’s unpredictability. They wonder how far he will go in warning China and Iran about their behavior, whether he will back out of long-standing treaties and trade deals, tear up the nuclear agreement with Iran, build a border wall with Mexico, or cozy up to Moscow. Tillerson, the former Exxon Mobil CEO, has international business experience but none in government. State Department officials said he would meet with counterparts from Britain, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Italy and Oman while in Bonn, and participate in larger meetings on Yemen and Syria. He also will hold his first meeting as secretary of state with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov at a time when Trump administration contacts with Moscow are under the spotlight with the resignation of national security adviser Michael Flynn. Flynn had been the new administration’s main contact for many foreign ambassadors to the United States. “The conversation with Mr. Lavrov will be a very important one,” a senior State Department official said, speaking to reporters ahead of Tillerson’s departure. During his meeting with Lavrov on Thursday, Tillerson will seek “pragmatic and constructive cooperation in areas where our interests overlap,” the official said. “The obvious ones which have been discussed many times are counter-ISIS and counterterrorism would be areas that the Secretary would hope to develop some possible avenues for cooperation,” the official said. He will also press Russia to fully implement the Minsk peace accords to end violence in eastern Ukraine. The G20 is made up of developed economies and emerging nations such as China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, South Africa and Brazil. Jim Wilkinson, a senior adviser to former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, said it was vital for Tillerson to establish a relationship with fellow ministers during his first trip. “That chemistry with counterparts begins on the first trip,” he said. “Secretary Tillerson and his counterparts will be working on some of the toughest issues around the world and that’s going to require trust.” While Tillerson has been on the job for just two weeks and may not be immersed in all subjects yet, Wilkinson said: “Foreign ministers will be understanding that in the early days he may not have all the answers, but they will want to know they have a conduit to someone who can speak for the U.S.”",1,fakenewsnet,,Tillerson arrives in Bonn amid questions over U.S. foreign policy

"Shawn Helton 21st Century WireGOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trump is a populist candidate among a bevy of warhawk rivals yet many still wonder how the real estate mogul has marched virtually unabated towards the 2016 Republican nomination.Undoubtedly, the stir Trump has caused this election season is already historic. Love him or hate him, the well-known businessman and reality TV star turned American political juggernaut is emerging as a surprising voice for US national interests in the face of an ever-increasing globalized world.Below we ll examine Trump s shocking rise in American politics, his strengths, his weaknesses and what he s up against HAWKISH DOVE Who s the real Donald Trump? (Photo illustration Shawn Helton of 21WIRE)The Curious Case of Donald Trump Back in 1993, brothers David and Tom Gardner founded The Motley Fool stockbroker consultancy, and at the time, it took the investment world by storm. Their mantra was simple: in business (as it is most everything else in life) timing is everything, and when a market or system becomes insular and stagnant, the conditions are ripe for a rule breaker , and eventually, the rule breakers becomes the rule makers. This spirit of guerilla business also underpinned the Silicon Valley revolution in the 1990s and 2000s.Likewise, Donald Trump read the tea leaves and saw an opportunity in 2016.If you believe the United States is ruled by an elite establishment or is a country taken hold by statism, endless foreign intervention and crony corporatism, chances are you might be considering Donald Trump as your candidate of choice in the 2016 presidential election and you wouldn t be alone. Similar sentiments are felt on the left-wing by supporters of Democratic Party outsider Bernie Sanders.Trump s outsider tag and anti-establishment veneer, is what seems to be resonating most among a broad base across America, as many believe that the country has been in a decline following two failed administrations in the White House under both Bush and Obama.This is the nature of populist campaigns and whether you like Trump or not, he s run one of the most effective presidential campaigns in American history, despite major backlash from the media and various political pressure groups attempting to stop his rise.The New PopulistsMuch like former Republican congressman Ron Paul in 2012, and to a lesser degree with Bernie Sanders, Trump has seemingly tapped into a cultural zeitgeist rarely seen in American politics as this year s preeminent populist choice.While Paul s staunch constitutional and libertarian beliefs propelled his popularity in 2012, it s Trump s cross-spectrum political thinking that s drawing supporters to his campaign marked by an ability to reach the average blue-collar worker, as well as successful entrepreneurs by bringing up issues concerning economic growth, immigration and global trade.To some critics however, Trump is not conservative enough, even though he s already unveiled one of the most comprehensive plans to uphold gun rights in modern history. The plan includes a proposal for nationwide concealed carry without placing a ban on certain types of guns or magazines something which has become a hot button particularly for those on the left after a string of strange mass shooting events during much of 2015.On the other side of the political fence, many have criticized Trump s antiquated views on expanding torture techniques in the military, as well as his tough talk on internet security, privacy concerns and heavy stance on illegal immigration.The term super-nationalistic is being batted around to describe Trump s perspective, causing some to fear the unknown.Ironically, what has led to Trump s success has also hindered him and has arguably become a major weak point for the shrewd businessman.Trump s fiery rhetoric concerning certain issues facing America today, in some cases has worked against him, and has painted a target on him, opening the door for the media to spin anything he says, or doesn t say, or what others say about him.This is perhaps best exemplified with his tough talk on illegal immigration, along with his media counter attack against professional agitators and protesters at his events following several clashes at some of his rallies over the past few weeks.Unfortunately, his detractors and political rivals have already used these social triggers to attack the GOP frontrunner, as his Chicago rally was cancelled after erupting into a chaotic scene, leading to at least 5 arrests. Similarly, his St. Louis rally was also stormed, leading to 32 arrests, with much of the media joining in condemnation of the embattled businessman.While no one should condone the violence that results from Trump supporters clashing with outside political agitators at Trump s campaign events, critics insist that Trump has somehow escalated these volatile protests through his own incendiary language and for not using his powers of persuasion to calm things down. Later on in this article, we ll take an even closer look at what s behind these seismic uprisings at Trump s campaign rallies.The Manhattan mogul s political story has only just begun and there are many things to consider concerning the embattled GOP frontrunner WAR LIES Former Secretary of State, Colin Powell and the Bush administration s findings revealed a highly coordinated disinformation campaign that led to over half a million deaths in the US-led invasion in Iraq in 2003. (Photo link foreignpolicyjournal)Alternative To War?Recently, Trump was pressed again on matters concerning the Middle East and his response has been surprisingly diplomatic with a non-interventionist platform. Trump s open condemnation of the Bush administration for the Iraq war and the Obama White House for the destruction of Libya, has resonated across the board for voters on both sides of the political spectrum. Trump has asserted that 2003 s invasion in Iraq and the blitzkrieg in Libya via NATO members in 2011, is further evidence of failed US foreign policy throughout the world.Doubling down, the GOP frontrunner Trump, has also refused to pick a side between Israel and Palestine and in true form to his business pedigree, stating that he would rather attempt to broker a peace deal in the ages old conflict, rather than tow the party line.Calling Out Bad Global Trade TRANS PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP US leaders vote in favor of cloaked trade deal involving Asia pacific countries and America in 2015. Trump has been the only presidential candidate talking about the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal and its vast implications on the global economy.The Trans Pacific Partnership or TPP trade deal, is something we ve covered extensively at 21WIRE over the past two years, as international trade law for new trade treaties appear to be a way for private corporations to exempt themselves from the laws of sovereign nations under the guise of a so-called free-trade agreement.As global policy makers continue to merge with the interests of multinational or transnational corporations to achieve their goals, we could view the TTP or the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) as having zero national loyalty to any existing nation-state or its set of laws.These multi-national and transnational free trade deals have been vigorously opposed by Trump during many GOP debates this election cycle. Other critics of these deals have suggested they are being used as a way to gain a foothold on property rights in the future, in addition to having lasting implications on intellectual property.21WIRE previously outlined the role that the United States Trade Representative has played in facilitating these deals between different industries: Understanding the power structure behind these draconian trade deals reveals the global chess play at work and the behind-the-scenes corporate merger s, under the watch of a biased government entity, the USTR. The USTR has been doing heavy lifting through its corporate connections with the likes of Haliburton (ESG and KBR) and Monsanto Corp, and political insider ties for a massive trade deal that will consolidate our future all done outside of the democratic process. This past week, Huffington Post published an article entitled At Secretive Meeting, Tech CEOs And Top Republicans Commiserate, Plot To Stop Trump, : Billionaires, tech CEOs and top members of the Republican establishment flew to a private island resort off the coast of Georgia this weekend for the American Enterprise Institute s annual World Forum, according to sources familiar with the secretive gathering. The article goes on to say that the participants couldn t help discussing Trump but he was not the sole purpose of the meeting. Here s some of the list of attendees as reported by HuffPo: Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google co-founder Larry Page, Napster creator and Facebook investor Sean Parker, and Tesla Motors and SpaceX honcho Elon Musk all attended. So did Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), political guru Karl Rove, House Speaker Paul Ryan, GOP Sens. Tom Cotton (Ark.), Cory Gardner (Colo.), Tim Scott (S.C.), Rob Portman (Ohio) and Ben Sasse (Neb.), who recently made news by saying he cannot support Donald Trump. Recently, it was reported by Cleveland.com that Ohio lost 112,500 jobs in 2015 resulting from the United States trade deficit with countries that are part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, according to an analysis by the Economic Policy Institute. Additionally, the EPI s findings state that an estimated 2 million jobs have already been lost due to the TPP and that half of those were in manufacturing industry.Above all else, Trump s non-interventionist outlook on the Middle East and his diplomatic approach to Israel and Palestine, as well as his strong position on free trade deals such as the TPP and TTIP, have all contributed to placing the outspoken candidate on the political chopping block.Such is the curious case of Donald J. Trump AMERICAN PSYCHO? Former presidential candidate Mitt Romney propelled Trump s campaign despite his desperate appeal to the public last week in a staged pre-debate speech. (Photo link cowgernation)Political Attack DogsThe anti-Trump coalition consists of the Republican Party establishment, the Leftwing and the mainstream media and each of these factions are presently at war with Trump and his campaign.From the onset, you could see the horror in TV broadcasters eyes when confronted by Trump a media mogul himself who knows how to conduct a symphony on the airwaves. In many respects, he s their worst nightmare a politician who can outplay them in their media manipulation game.For the American Leftwing, he induces revulsion, and for good reason his ability to tame the media has enabled him to discard the political correctness which governs US media discourse.The most sustained attack however, is coming from his own party. In the September of 2015, here at 21WIRE, we discussed how neoconservatives within the Republican Party were incensed when Trump first launched his presidential campaign bid over the summer. Flashing forward to now, it s even more apparent that the media and the dying GOP party elite have attempted to shanghai Trump and the public during his unexpected political rise.Since last summer, there s been a host of media pundits and Washington figureheads looking to take on Trump in a kinda of metaphorical Thunderdome, something which has routinely played out before millions of TV viewers and one by one, each has become politically castrated, spayed or otherwise cast aside by the outspoken tycoon.You don t have to take my word for it, just ask Meghan Kelley, Lindsay Graham, Jeb Bush, as well as former FOX News favorite and PNAC (Project for a New American Century) waving neocon, Marco Rubio a list, that may now include Mitt Romney, following his dirty, scripted propaganda speech meant to quell Trump s primary rise.It seems this year more than any other, the American public has peeled away at the politically fixed halls of FOX, CNN and others, as mainstream networks have deliberately attempted to derail Trump through a plethora of designer media attacks, timely gotcha questions, ambush-style interviews and scripted debate forums working in concert to keep the apparent GOP outsider off-balance throughout the entire presidential nomination process. Astute observers of the GOP nomination process, might conclude that many media personalities, political insiders and beltway lobbyists are comfortable with America s long ago chartered cruise towards global ambiguity and perpetual stagnation, rather than to take a chance on new blood.In fact, The Grand Old Party pet-parade nearly flatlined last week after enlisting Bain Capital businessman and former Governor of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney to unleash a scathing nationally televised assessment of Trump s presidential qualifications.Bain Capital, is an investment firm with a rich history of litigation concerning claims of disgruntled investors over profits, as well as a global company with big ties to military defense, aerospace and big agricultural giants like Monsanto.Romney s recent pre-GOP debate speech appeared to be a last-ditch effort directed by neoconservative strategists to silence Trump s campaign but it led to a huge backlash and in the process, revealed the former governor s role as political spoiler (and thus damaged goods), as evidenced by his support of Bush-approved candidate John Kasich.Romney s speech, piggy-backed anti-Trump hashtag campaigns (#nevertrump and #stoptrump) that emerged in the weeks following an article by well-known neoconservative strategist, Peter Wehner on why he wouldn t support a Trump presidency.Here s a You Tube clip of Fox News contributor Judge Jeanine Pirro condemning Romney for awakening a sleeping giant among the US electorate The Shape of ThingsMitt Romney and the billionaire boys club are out for blood.Trump is using big media to put out some dangerous ideas like the prospect for a peace deal between Israel and Palestine, and d tente with Russia, and also calling out the clear fraud of the Iraq War, as well as NATO s bombardment in Libya as Trump stated, Libya would be better off if we had left Gaddafi in power. If the politicians had gone to the beach instead, and did nothing, we d be better off in Libya and Iraq than we are today. Romney represents the financial and investment wing of the military industrial complex and an Israel first foreign policy. Along with John McCain, Romney is one of their inside men embedded inside the US political establishment.This is what Trump is really up against.It doesn t stop there, the dirty politricks continued this week as Rubio urged his supporters to vote for rival presidential candidate and Governor of Ohio John Kasich (a close Bush-family friend), with the Florida Senator stating, If you re a Republican primary voter in Ohio, and you don t want Donald Trump to be the nominee, John Kasich is your best bet. Incidentally, Jeb Bush met with three non-Trump candidates (Cruz, Rubio Kasich?) in Miami this week, a month after dropping out of the presidential race, due to his poor campaign results. The situation was described by the Wall Street Journal as the following: Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who ended his 2016 candidacy last month after months of sparring with Mr. Trump, met with each of the three non-Trump candidates this week in Miami, though he hasn t offered direction on how to block Mr. Trump s path. On another interesting note, early in March, according to The Hill, CEO of FOX News, Roger Ailes, dropped his support for Rubio, if true, the move would signify this latest strategy to use Romney and Kasich as a way to undermine Trump s campaign. Here s the excerpt reported by The Hill: We re finished with Rubio, Roger Ailes told one of the network s hosts recently, according to three unnamed sources. We can t do the Rubio thing anymore. Flashing forward to this past week, Trump loyalist Roger Stone, wrote a revealing article entitled Ted Cruz, A Bush By Another Name, which detailed GOP presidential candidate Ted Cruz s close relationship to the Bush family. Here s a passage from Stone s recent piece at The Daily Caller: Neil Bush, the son of President George H. W. Bush, who defrauded U.S. taxpayers out of $1.5 billion dollars in the savings and loan scam, and later peddled influence for the Chinese government, (who plied him with Chinese prostitutes) has formally endorsed Senator Ted Cruz for president. You can t make this stuff up. The Bush-Cruz connection is clear. Ted was George W. s brain when he ran for president. A top policy adviser, Ted maneuvered for Solicitor General in Bush World but settled for a plum at the Federal Trade Commission. Ted s a Bush man with deep ties to the political and financial establishment. Ted and wife Heidi brag about being the first Bush marriage they met as Bush staffers. SEE ALSO: Ted Cruz comes up empty on Obamacare as government continues debt scamAs the political claws are fully out now, the recent words of Pulitzer prize nominated journo, Jon Rappoport, comes to mind: A true populist leader would accept the fact that working through usual channels, to bring about stunning changes, is a loser. The enemy is entrenched. The enemy controls the landscape. The enemy controls the machinery. Where is the populist s strength coming from? Only one place: the people who are supporting him. So he has to go back to that well, over and over again. And now he can. While pondering Trump s rivals and populism, there s a deeper agenda concerning 2016 and beyond, something which was recently pointed out here at 21WIRE.In October of 2014, The Boston Globe published a stirring article rarely seen in the mainstream entitled Vote all you want. The secret government won t change. The Globe piece covered Tufts University political scientist Michael J. Glennon s detailed perspective on the political process in America. The article included an in-depth discussion about Glennon s book National Security and Double Government, a book that gives the public an inside look into the collusion between neoconservative and neoliberal political strategy on the global stage in particular, counterterrorism policies that are routinely followed by president after president.The idea of concealed policy between neoconservatives and neoliberals was further confirmed when Robert Kagan, a co-founder and co-author of The Project for the New American Century, recently endorsed Hillary Clinton for President.This was a big story, but it barely kept the media s attention span for longer than a week.Indeed, Kagan s endorsement should provide a window for people to see the so-called (neo) conservative players behind the scenes that might have helped Clinton escape the Benghazi scandal and might step in to rescue her from her ongoing national security related email case with the FBI.Clinton s exploits in Libya are well documented and her recent endorsement by neocon strategist Kagan, is just one more glaring example of political complicity, no matter who gets elected as the president of America, the foreign policy machinations are controlled by the same operators.Coincidentally or not, Kagan also appears to be linked to Romney s anti-trump plea to the public.In a catchy call to arms, a deeply biased political plea was published on the website called War On The Rocks. The piece featured an impassioned rant from those directly connected to the military industrial complex. In fact, many war party operatives, put their seal of approval on the message including Robert Kagan, as well as Former Homeland Security secretary, Michael Chertoff, (the Chertoff Group manufactured the TSA body scanners used in most major airports) as well as over hundred other political operatives.To those aware of these tactics, the War On The Rocks Trump hit-piece, read like a foreign policy business as usual dossier, with a heavy-handed characterization of mogul, while completely misrepresenting some of Washington s most notorious military interventions in recent memory.

(Photo link ulinet)Socially Engineered Flash Mobs Go Viral The political game changers are fully after the Trump campaign now, as the George Soros funded advocacy group MoveOn, played a large role in the Chicago University student organized shutdown at the Trump rally this past Friday, as well as a host of other splinter groups associated with Black Lives Matter (BLM) and supporters for Bernie Sanders. BLACK BLOC Black bloc provocateurs, have violently escalated protest movements since the 1980 s, including 2011 s Occupy Wall Street Movement. (Photo link examiner)The echoes are still felt from the Soros funded protests in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014 and the Baltimore riots of 2015, something which immediately recalls the misguided machinations of The Occupy Movement (aka OWS) in 2011, an event that turned out to be a think-tank-spun divide and conquer stratagem designed to push naive participants into violent action. CHICAGO CHAOS Bernie Sanders supporters join Black Lives Matter linked groups to shutdown Trump rally. (Photo link twitter)Back in January, MoveOn publicly endorsed the Bernie Sanders campaign in what appeared to be a call to action for BLM associated groups seen backing Sanders. It s worth mentioning, that MoveOn, also supported the Obama campaign in 2008, according to the website, Sanders is the only other candidate to threshold for an endorsement. From here on out, professional political agitator flash mobs, will be mobilized at future Trump campaign events, making it very difficult to run a normal campaign taking away Trump s strength in numbers at his rallies. This was confirmed in Ohio recently, after a BLM activist and Sanders supporter, stormed the stage, shortly after Trump started speaking.In a Politico article entitled Major donors consider funding Black Lives Matter, we gain deeper insight into the political funding for BLM and the Soros linked Democratic Alliance: Major donors are usually not as radical or confrontational as activists most in touch with the pain of oppression, said Steve Phillips, a Democracy Alliance member and significant contributor to Democratic candidates and causes. He donated to a St. Louis nonprofit group called the Organization for Black Struggle that helped organize 2014 Black Lives Matter-related protests in Ferguson, Missouri, over the police killing of a black teenager named Michael Brown. And Phillips and his wife, Democracy Alliance board member Susan Sandler, are in discussions about funding other groups involved in the movement. It worth noting Soros, a long time contributor to Hillary Clinton, donated $2 million in PAC money in 2015 and January of 2016, Soros reportedly gave $8 million to boost Clinton s campaign. Soros also recently funded $15 million to Latino groups looking to stop Trump s rise towards a potential GOP nomination and beyond.Any bloodshed at the hands of vigilante mobs at Trump rallies, should be the responsibility of those who of have sought to politicize and fund this agenda from the very beginning.Look for these political engineers, to pit choreographed conservative and liberal groups against each other at Trump s rallies or events in the future as all of these hostile uprisings are by design.During the Days of Rage in 1969, the FBI was said to have been tracking specific members of the Students for a Democratic Society. The SDS was heavily connected to 60 s political agitators turned domestic terrorists, The Weather Underground. Many concluded that the group s leader, Bill Ayers, was an interloper looking for new recruits that were easily manipulated into hostile action.This begs the question: Are government agencies still infiltrating political advocacy groups to push social change?The disruptions at Trump rallies are a form of modern class warfare, one that disguises its true intentions, eroding national sovereignty through a series of upheavals, while presenting shock and awe imagery in order to manipulate the public s political perspective.Amazingly through it all, Trump s still been able to confound his opposition in the aftermath of a barrage of attacks, propelling his popularity even to even higher levels.The Ides of March primaries will be a good barometer to see what impact these chaotic clashes may have on Trump s campaign moving forward.It still remains to be seen if Trump s dynamic political vision for America will push the country further into authoritarianism or whether he can unite an embattled nation by restoring international relations throughout the world.But one thing is for sure there s no doubt now that a systematic design is in place to unseat the GOP frontrunner and the public should question why READ MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files",0,fakenewsnet,,HAWKISH DOVE: The Enigma of Donald Trump in Volatile Race to the White House

"MOSCOW (Reuters) - A U.S. tip-off about a planned attack in St. Petersburg helped save many lives and Russia and the United States should try to cooperate in the same way in future, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday.

It cannot be called anything but an ideal example of cooperation in fighting terrorism, Peskov told reporters at a conference call. We should aim for such standards. The tip-off resulted in the detention of seven alleged supporters of the Islamic State militant group in St. Petersburg last week, Peskov said.

Peskov said Russian and American security services have contacts but this was the first time when their cooperation was so efficient.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Tuesday filed an emergency motion to stop sanctions imposed by a federal judge in Texas that included mandated ethics classes for federal prosecutors, as part of ongoing litigation over immigration policy. The sanctions were ordered on May 19 by District Judge Andrew Hanen, who ruled in February 2015 that President Barack Obama’s executive actions on immigration were outside the bounds of the president’s authority. Hanen also ordered the Department of Homeland Security to prepare a state-by-state review of immigrants who were given three years of safeguards from deportation under Obama’s previous immigration action instead of two. The case has been brought before the U.S. Supreme Court. The Justice Department asked Hanen to put a hold on the sanctions while it seeks a review from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Justice Department will ask the Fifth Circuit for an appeal of the decision, a mandamus order or both to block the sanction order. In the court filing, in Houston, the Justice Department said it “takes with utmost seriousness the public trust committed to it to represent the interests of the American people in the courts of the United States, and insists that its attorneys adhere to the high standards of ethical conduct and professionalism required to carry out that critical mission.” “The court’s order to turn over immigration records would undermine trust in the Department of Homeland Security’s ability to maintain the confidentiality of personal information, which is essential to its mission,” said Patrick Rodenbush, a spokesman for the Justice Department, in connection with the review ordered by Hanen.",1,fakenewsnet,,Justice Department asks for hold on court sanctions in immigration case

"Well, sad to say, it s a sure chance the next president of our beloved United States of America is going to be Donald Trump. It s disappointing to say the least that our country could actually elect a man like him. However, the electoral college has mostly spoken, and there s not much we can do at this point.Now, the people of America who voted against Trump are trying to escape as they realize all they have done was in vain. By escape I mean, they are fleeing to Canada, in such large quantities that they have successfully caused Canada s immigration to crash. That s right, even with unofficial results in, they know something s gotta give.The best part is this isn t the first time Canada s website crashed from desperate Americans. During Super Tuesday the site crashed, and also the Google search for move to Canada spiked significantly. Now, Canada has a reputation for being nice. So nice that they responded with an advertisement: Test Drive Canada . Isn t that something?It s not a big surprise that those who despise Mr. Trump would look toward our friendly Northern-Neighbours. After all, they have great healthcare, welfare, friendly to Obama, and don t forget the maple syrup. What s not to love? Just one little problem with everyone leaving though. The less people here in America who still stand against Trump the more he can do what he wants with our country. Some of us want to stay here and thwart our new orange president every chance we get. The less of us here to do so, well, the less he ll be thwarted. So for the love of America, as tempting as it might be, don t leave. Stay here, stand together, and let s all say screw you, Trump! together.

"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Documentary filmmaker and liberal activist Michael Moore launched a website called “TrumpiLeaks” on Tuesday to allow whistleblowers to securely leak information to him about U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration. “Patriotic Americans in government, law enforcement or the private sector with knowledge of crimes, breaches of public trust and misconduct committed by Donald J. Trump and his associates are needed to blow the whistle in the name of protecting the United States of America from tyranny,” Moore wrote in an open letter on the Huffington Post. “I know this is risky. I knew we may get in trouble. But too much is at stake to play it safe,” Moore wrote. Moore, 63, said that while no digital communication was 100 percent secure, he and his team had used the most secure technology possible to protect anonymity. “TrumpiLeaks” was announced one day after the U.S. Department of Justice said that a 25-year-old U.S. intelligence contractor had been arrested and charged with leaking classified National Security Agency material related to Russian interference in the 2016 American presidential election to a news organization.Trump has called for a crackdown on leaks to the media. Moore, a longtime champion of liberal causes and outspoken critic of Trump, is working on a documentary about the 2016 presidential election. His other films include “Fahrenheit 9/11,” which was a critical look at the presidency of George W. Bush and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The filmmaker gained fame with the 1989 documentary “Roger and Me” about his hometown of Flint, Michigan, and 2002’s “Bowling for Columbine.” The TrumpiLeaks site is a portal on Michael Moore’s personal website. His open letter was also posted on his homepage.

"Donald Trump s new strategy to spin away from the sexual assault avalanche that is burying him apparently includes accusing Hillary Clinton of sexual assault.Because that s exactly what Trump minion Gina Loudon did during an appearance on CNN with Don Lemon on Monday night.Loudon and fellow Trump minion Betsey McCaughey tried to steer the discussion from Trump s sexual assault comments to claims of mass election fraud, which Trump has repeatedly tried to convince everyone is a thing that actually happens even though it is incredibly rare in our country.At that point, panelist Bakari Sellers had had enough and shut both women down to return the discussion to the topic at hand. This is absurd, Sellers said. Bless your heart, both of you, this is patently absurd. You talked about the fact that Donald Trump somehow had allegations that were unproven. No. Melania Trump was on camera today, trying to deal with his own comments coming out of his mouth. We weren t even at the allegations. We were at the point that he said he likes to sexually abuse people. You cannot be serious, Loudon exclaimed. But Sellers refused to back down. That s sexual assault, is it not? he asked.Indeed, Trump bragged about groping women against their will back in 2005 while on a hot mic while on Access Hollywood. Groping women against their will is the exact definition of sexual assault. But Loudon has a totally different definition and she openly stated it on national television when she openly accused Hillary Clinton of sexually assaulting Bill Clinton s accusers. Words are not sexual assault, she claimed. What is sexual assault is what Hillary Clinton did to the women her husband absolutely, factually assaulted. Wow. Donald Trump s supporters literally just sunk to a new low in their desperate effort to paint Hillary as worse than the Republican nominee.Lemon and Sellers were stunned by the ridiculous accusation and former Philadelphia mayor Michael Nutter told the two women that they are embarrassing themselves.Loudon insisted that Hillary paid $100,000 to a private investigator to dig up bad stuff on these women, but when Lemon and Nutter told her there was no evidence of her claims, the best Loudon could offer is that there is an alleged tape and that she has heard it. In other words, hearsay, which is not evidence.Nutter went on to slam Donald Trump as a liar and he actually listed off many of the things Trump has lied about, and unlike Loudon s claim, there is evidence to back him up.Here s the video via VidMe.Donald Trump has no business being a candidate for the presidency and his supporters should not be allowed on national media programs. All they have done is lie throughout this campaign and accusing Hillary of sexual assault should be the last time Gina Loudon is ever invited back on CNN or any other news outlet.Featured image via screenshot",0,fakenewsnet,, WATCH: Trump Supporter Accuses Hillary Of Sexual Assault And CNN Panel Demolishes Them
"Tensions ran high outside of a campaign rally for Donald Trump in St. Louis, Missouri.

"A plea deal for this punk will really make another terrorist think twice before attacking a major subway system or harming innocent Americans in the name of Allah The federal government s case against suspected Islamic State adherent Nicholas Teausant may have moved one step closer Tuesday to resolution without a trial, as a prosecutor said she will seek permission from Washington, D.C., to offer a deal to the defendant.In a brief hearing Tuesday morning in Sacramento s downtown federal courthouse, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jean Hobler said prosecutors must seek approval from the Justice Department s national security division before making an offer to Teausant and his lawyers.That offer is expected to be made to Teausant s defense team within a week, Hobler told U.S. District Judge John A. Mendez, who agreed to push the case back until Nov. 17, with the possibility of a guilty plea to an as-yet-undefined charge.Assistant Federal Defender Matthew Scoble told the judge lawyers are cautiously optimistic a resolution of the case can be reached.Documents filed in the case since Teausant s March 2014 arrest have teased out the notion that both sides were seeking a way to settle the matter without going to trial.Teausant, whose 22nd birthday is on Monday, is charged with one count of attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization, a charge that could net a 15-year prison sentence and $250,000 fine.He appeared in court Tuesday in an orange jail jumpsuit but did not speak during the hearing.Teausant said in a jailhouse interview with The Sacramento Bee in August 2014 that he hoped for a plea bargain that would incorporate some leniency. He denied wanting to stage any attacks against Americans.A former community college student and National Guard washout who lived in Acampo, near Lodi, Teausant was arrested as he tried to cross the border into Canada near Blaine, Wash.The FBI and prosecutors say his trip was part of a plan to travel to Syria to join the Islamic State, which has become the Obama administration s primary focus in its efforts against worldwide terror attacks.Court documents say he was tripped up by an informant and undercover FBI agent.Teausant s case has been delayed in part by questions about his mental state. In December 2014, the court found he was not competent, but after subsequent evaluations, he was found competent in August and the case proceeded.Another reason for some delay is that the prosecution includes evidence classified as secret by the government.Teausant, who is being held without bail at the Sacramento County jail, has been described in court papers as boasting of wanting to bomb the Los Angeles subway system and blow up his infant daughter s day care center because it was a Zionist reform church. He allegedly boasted of wanting to train Islamic State fighters.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee issued a subpoena on Wednesday demanding documents related to Russia from President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser Michael Flynn, ramping up its monthslong investigation of Moscow’s alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. In a joint statement, Senators Richard Burr, the committee’s Republican chairman, and Mark Warner, its top Democrat, said the committee had first requested the documents from Flynn in a April 28 letter, but the retired lieutenant general had declined, through counsel, to cooperate with the committee’s request. It was the first subpoena announced by the committee in its investigation. Warner said on Tuesday that the committee has been receiving documents as it investigates allegations that Russia sought to influence the U.S. election, something Moscow denies. But he told Reuters that some people were not complying “so we were going to take next steps.” The Trump administration denies any collusion with Russia. Flynn has been a focus of investigations into Russia and the election. He was forced to resign in February as Trump’s national security adviser for failing to disclose the content of his talks with Sergey Kislyak, Russia’s ambassador to the United States, and then misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations. Former Acting U.S. Attorney General Sally Yates testified at a high-profile hearing on Monday that she had warned the White House in January that Flynn had been compromised and could have been vulnerable to blackmail by Russia. The subpoena was announced a day after Trump abruptly fired FBI Director James Comey, who had been leading the bureau’s investigation of Russia and the election. Comey’s firing prompted a storm of criticism from Democrats, who accused the president of seeking to stall the probe. Some of Trump’s fellow Republicans, including Burr, also expressed strong doubts about the timing of Trump’s action.",1,fakenewsnet,,Senate committee subpoenas former Trump adviser Flynn over Russia

"ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan s Finance Minister Ishaq Dar has been relieved of his duties, local media said on Wednesday, following speculation about his future after he failed to appear in court to answer corruption charges. Documents seen by Reuters show Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi granted Dar sick leave on Wednesday, while local TV channels Geo and Samaa said he had been relieved of his portfolio. Dar would keep his status as a minister for the time being, Geo reported. Dar, who is receiving medical treatment in London for a heart condition, has an arrest warrant issued against him after he missed multiple court appearances on charges that he had amassed wealth beyond his known sources of income. The case had, along with Pakistan s worsening economic outlook, led to mounting calls for him to resign. The country is battling to stave off balance of payments pressures due to a dwindling foreign currency reserve and a widening current account deficit. A spokesman for the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz could not immediately be reached for comment, nor could Dar. He has missed more than three weeks of court hearings conducted by the anti-graft agency, the National Accountability Bureau.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A healthcare bill being unveiled by U.S. Senate Republicans on Thursday is expected to roll back the Obamacare expansion of the Medicaid healthcare program for the poor and reshape subsidies to low-income people buying private insurance. Those subsidies are expected to be linked to recipients’ income, a “major improvement” from a healthcare overhaul bill passed in the House of Representatives that tied them solely to age, Republican Senator Susan Collins said on Wednesday. The Washington Post reported that the bill would also repeal most of the taxes that pay for the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, give states wider latitude to opt out of its regulations and eliminate federal funding for Planned Parenthood, a healthcare provider that offers abortion services. The healthcare bill will be released to the Republican Senate Conference on Thursday morning and posted online, senators said. A vote could come as soon as next week, several senators said. Senate Republicans have been working behind closed doors for weeks on legislation aimed at repealing and replacing major portions of Obamacare, former Democratic President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law. Obamacare extended insurance coverage to millions of Americans through both subsidized private insurance and an expansion of Medicaid. “There is an urgency to get this done because of the continued collapse of the Obama healthcare law,” Senator John Barrasso, a member of the Senate Republican leadership, told CNN. “People across the country are suffering pain and the pain is getting worse as insurance companies are pulling out.” Democrats accuse Republicans of sabotaging Obamacare, and say the Republican healthcare bill is aimed at cutting taxes for the wealthy. Democratic Senator Patty Murray of Washington said in a statement that leaked details of the bill indicated it was “every bit as devastating for families’ bank accounts and healthcare coverage as the disastrous bill that passed in the House.” President Donald Trump and fellow Republicans campaigned last year on a pledge to replace and repeal Obamacare, which they described as ineffective and government intrusion in a key sector of the economy. Some Republican senators voiced concern on Wednesday about the rush to consider the major legislation as their party’s leaders prepare to unveil it. Republican Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin said he wanted to read the bill and discuss it with constituents before he votes. “I’d find it hard to believe we’ll have enough time,” he said, adding that if he did not get enough information, “I won’t be voting yes.” Democrats hoping to block the healthcare measure in the Republican-led Senate need at least two Republicans to defect. The Democrats have criticized the behind-the-scenes meetings, and blocked Senate committees on Wednesday from meeting for over two hours in protest. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, defending the closed-door sessions, has said all Senate Republicans have had a chance to participate in meetings on the bill, and that Democrats are not interested in overhauling Obamacare. Once the plan is unveiled, Senate Republicans will face a skeptical public that thinks the House version would be harmful for low-income Americans and people with pre-existing health conditions, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday. Trump told a rally in Iowa on Wednesday night that he hoped the Senate would come up with a “really good” bill. “I’ve been talking about a plan with heart,” Trump said. He had privately called the House legislation “mean,” according to congressional sources. Several weeks of negotiations over the bill have been plagued by tensions between moderates and conservatives. Much of the battle has been over how quickly to phase out the Medicaid expansion that took place under Obamacare. Moderates favored a seven-year phase-out, but the Senate leadership proposed three years starting in 2020. There was also an argument over Medicaid’s growth rate going forward, with conservatives favoring lowering the growth rate in 2025. “That’s what we’re told it might be,” said Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana. Cassidy said senators had also been told the legislation would continue funding cost-sharing subsidies made available to help low-income Americans under Obamacare “for a couple of years.” Collins, a moderate Republican from Maine, said she wanted to read an assessment by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office on its impact on cost and insurance coverage before making her decision. “The first concern is how many people will lose coverage and what do the demographics of that group look like,” she said. An estimated 23 million people could lose their healthcare under a similar plan narrowly passed last month by the Republican-controlled House, according to the CBO.",1,fakenewsnet,,Senate healthcare bill expected to cut back Medicaid expansion

"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Syrian and Iraqi forces closing in on the last scraps of Islamic State s caliphate straddling the remote border area between the two countries have already witnessed the jihadists likely response. While their comrades mounted last stands in their Syrian capital of Raqqa and the city of Hawija in Iraq, IS militants seized the Syrian town of al-Qaryatayn and launched its biggest attack for months in Ramadi late last month. That is the kind of guerrilla insurgency both countries foresee IS turning to. It is expected that after the Daesh terrorist organization s capacity to fight in the field is finished, its remnants will resort to this type of (guerrilla) operation. But for a certain period of time, not forever, said a Syrian military source, using an Arabic acronym for Islamic State. The continued ability for IS to mount attacks in areas where it was thought to have been eliminated will hinder efforts to stabilize regions when the fighting wanes. In Iraq, where Islamic State originated, it has a proven record of falling back upon local networks from which it can rise anew when conditions allow. So far, it has not shown it has the same capacity in Syria, and it might find doing so more challenging there than in Iraq. The sectarian divisions on which it thrives are less pronounced in Syria, and it faces competition there for jihadist loyalty from other powerful militant groups. Daesh is in essence an Iraqi organization, it will survive to some extent in Iraq. Syrian members will dissolve in other Syrian Salafi jihadist groups, said Hisham Hashami, an adviser on Islamic State to the Iraqi government. But in both countries it has shown it can exploit holes left by overstretched enemies to carry out spectacular attacks - the one in Syria s al-Qaryatayn most clearly - that spread panic and tie down opposing forces. It has also proved able to carry out bombings and assassinations in areas controlled by the Iraqi and Syrian governments, U.S.-backed Kurdish militias and rival jihadist rebel groups, signaling an ability to survive underground. A jihadist from a Syrian rebel faction opposed to Islamic State said the group had won enough support among young men to give it a latent capacity to revive. I believe that it is possible, given that its ideology has spread widely among the youths, that something new will emerge, the jihadist said, pointing to the highly effective propaganda machine deployed by Islamic State over the last three years. The al-Qaryatayn attack began on the evening of 29 September, when up to 250 militants with guns, rockets and mortars spread around the area with terrible speed , said Ayman al-Fayadh, a resident. It was particularly alarming because the government had declared al-Qaryatayn safe months ago, and had helped its residents to move back into their homes. When the jihadists were finally forced out after three weeks of fighting around the outskirts of al-Qaryatayn, they took their revenge, slaughtering scores of its inhabitants. They were very bloodthirsty and didn t spare anyone, Fayadh said. The Syrian military source said it took three weeks to retake the town because it was inhabited and the army was trying to avoid civilian casualties. However, the attack showed how towns in Syria s deserts, where armed forces can be spread only thinly, are vulnerable to Islamic State and that such operations can tie down opposing armies. People are afraid of Daesh returning, said a Syrian journalist who visited the town this week. They killed anyone who had taken part in pro-government protests. Bodies had been thrown in streets and in wells. Fayadh also said townspeople were among the attackers, indicating that Islamic State used its years of rule to build local support networks and establish sleeper cells for future attacks - something that could be replicated elsewhere in Syria. They re going to continue to have to look for places where they can plan and finance and resource and launch their attacks from, said Colonel Ryan Dillon, spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition, noting Islamic State had often used sparsely populated areas . The assault on Ramadi took place three days before. Militants attacked Iraqi security forces with suicide car bombs, mortars and machine guns in a city that it had apparently lost months earlier. The big challenge in both Iraq and Syria is to co-opt the Sunni Arab tribes, or risk a revival of jihadist insurgency. The Suuni-Shi ite divide has plagued Iraq since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 that ignited the civil war. Shi ite parties backed by Iran have dominated the government and used militia forces against mostly Sunni insurgents. The Syrian government may have the same problem. It is allied to the region s main Shi ite powers - Iran and militia groups such as Lebanon s Hezbollah - and led by a president, Bashar al-Assad, from a Shi ite offshoot sect. It will also be a challenge for the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) alliance in northern Syria, which is spearheaded by Kurdish groups. They have sometimes struggled to convince Arabs that it will protect their interests. It all depends on the degree to which those fighting under Assad and the SDF incorporate settled tribes into governing structures, said Andrew Tabler, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East policy. Even in northwestern Syria, where rebel groups including jihadist factions hold sway, hardship and insurgent infighting might create space for Islamic State to again seize ground. Beside the al-Qaryatayn attack, a group of Islamic State fighters have managed to take a pocket of territory in rebel-held areas near Hama in recent weeks, battling a rival jihadist group for control of several villages. It has used bomb attacks and assassinations to target government-held cities in the west, Kurdish security forces in the northeast and Islamist rebel factions in the northwest. In the isolated enclave it holds in Yarmouk camp south of Damascus, it has also shown renewed aggression, taking over the headquarters of a neighboring rebel group this month by force. The jihadist rebel said he believed Islamic State could repeat the strategy it used in Iraq last decade of retrenching when under attack, then rebounding in more virulent form. In this period of weakness, Islamic State depends on the ideology that it spread, the jihadist said. It appears that the same experience is being repeated. They could carry out bombings, a guerrilla war.",1,fakenewsnet,,Islamic State guerrilla attacks point to its future strategy

"You just can t make up stories like these Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein (Calif.) on Tuesday castigated the idea of moving the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, saying it would be a terrible decision despite previously voting for the embassy move to take place. Reports indicate the president will move the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, the California senator tweeted. I wrote him last week to explain why that would be a terrible decision. In an attached letter to Trump dated Dec. 1, Feinstein wrote that moving the embassy would spark violence and embolden extremists on both sides of this debate. Here is the tweet:Reports indicate the president will move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. I wrote him last week to explain why that would be a terrible decision. pic.twitter.com/MV1o73nyDk Sen Dianne Feinstein December 5, 2017The California Democrat stressed that the U.S. must remain neutral in the debate over Jerusalem s status, and that moving the U.S. embassy there or recognizing the city as the capital of Israel would undermine any remaining hope for a two-state solution. Feinstein s tweet came on the same day that President Donald Trump told Israeli and Arab leaders that he plans to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital and move the embassy there. Trump is expected to announce his decision on Wednesday.Moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem would be in line with a law that Congress passed in 1995 requiring the relocation of the United States embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. The measure, which also called for the U.S. to recognize the city as the undivided capital of Israel, passed the Senate by an overwhelming 93-5 margin.Among the senators who voted for the initial Jerusalem Embassy Act was one Dianne Feinstein.Feinstein actually played a key role in getting the bill passed by inserting a provision that would allow the president to issue a waiver to delay the embassy move six months at a time, if the president determined it was in the U.S. national security interest.Feinstein s move led 10 additional Democratic members to support the bill, giving it a veto-proof majority.Via: WFB",0,fakenewsnet,,HYPOCRISY: DEMOCRAT SENATOR Criticizes President Trump For Moving U.S. Embassy To Jerusalem After She Voted To Move U.S. Embassy To Jerusalem

"(Reuters) - Washington Governor Jay Inslee on Tuesday signed a bill that paves the way for the state to create what is believed to be the first system in the United States to certify marijuana as organic. The sponsor of the bill, Republican Senator Ann Rivers, said marijuana certified as organically grown is likely to be on sale in Washington in about a year and a half. Washington is among a handful of U.S. states where voters approved the sale of recreational marijuana. Washington was the second state to begin legal recreational pot sales, in mid-2014, after its voters in 2012 approved it. “This is consumer-driven,” Rivers told Reuters by phone on Tuesday night. “As we have moved forward in the legal marijuana market, we’re hearing people say, ‘We don’t want any pesticides, fungicides, none of that stuff in our weed.’” The new law “creates a voluntary program for the certification and regulation of organic marijuana products,” to be administered by the Washington agriculture department, according to a state analysis of the new law. Rivers said the “heavy lifting” in certifying marijuana has been done by the system of doing the same for a multitude of food products on supermarkets shelves across America. That process just needs to be adapted for pot, she said. Rivers said that legal recreational marijuana is “the gift that keeps on giving....this year, we’ll make $768 million” in revenue for the state of Washington. This pays for drug education and drug addiction treatment as well as public education, she said. Organic pot was just one of a myriad of marijuana-related measures in the bill. Many state legislators wanted to vote for only one marijuana-related bill rather than have to go on the record favoring marijuana several times, Rivers said. The November 2012 measure to allow recreational marijuana in Washington passed 56 percent to 44 percent. While it is legal for adults to smoke marijuana in Washington, it is not legal to grow industrial hemp. The new law allows for the study of a method to allow hemp to be grown and used for industrial purposes. Last week, Vermont’s legislature approved a bill to legalize recreational use of marijuana. Unless the measure is vetoed, Vermont would be the first state to legalize pot without a public vote. Voters have approved legal recreational marijuana use in Colorado, Washington, Alaska, Oregon, California, Nevada, Maine, Massachusetts and the District of Columbia.",1,fakenewsnet,,State of Washington law paves way for organic marijuana market

"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - An employee of Canadian aircraft and train maker Bombardier facing bribery charges in Sweden is to be released immediately from custody, his lawyer said on Wednesday. A 37-year-old Russian man was arrested in March on suspicion that he and several others at the company had bribed an Azerbaijani official to secure a contract worth around $340 million. The Stockholm district court has ordered the man - who denied the allegations - to be released immediately, his lawyer said. Our interpretation is that he will be completely acquitted, or that he is guilty only of a minor part of the accusation and, if so, has already served his time, the employee s lawyer Cristina Bergner told Reuters. The district court could not immediately be reached for comment. The prosecutor had demanded a sentence of five years in prison. The trial has concluded and sentencing is set for Oct. 11. In their March statement, Swedish prosecutors alleged Bombardier had won the tender in question after competitors that had offered better prices were disqualified by Azerbaijan s rail authority. The Canadian firm said in August it took the allegations very seriously as they ran counter to its values and high standards, and it supported an investigation into the facts.",1,fakenewsnet,,Swedish court orders Bombardier employee to be released from custody

"BEIJING (Reuters) - China called on Monday for all countries to make constructive efforts to ease tension after North Korea said the latest U.N. sanctions against it are an act of war and tantamount to a complete economic blockade. The U.N. Security Council unanimously imposed new sanctions on North Korea on Friday for its recent intercontinental ballistic missile test, seeking to limit its access to refined petroleum products and crude oil and its earnings from workers abroad. The U.S.-drafted resolution also caps crude oil supplies to North Korea at 4 million barrels a year and commits the Council to further reductions if it were to conduct another nuclear test or launch another intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). North Korea on Sunday rejected the resolution, calling it an act of war. Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the resolution appropriately strengthened the sanctions but was not designed to affect ordinary people, normal economic exchanges and cooperation, or humanitarian aid. Hua noted it also called for the use of peaceful means to resolve the issue and that all sides should take steps to reduce tension. In the present situation, we call on all countries to exercise restraint and make proactive and constructive efforts to ease the tensions on the peninsula and appropriately resolve the issue, she told a daily news briefing. The North s old allies China and Russia both supported the latest U.N. sanctions. Tension has been rising over North Korea s nuclear and missile programs, which it pursues in defiance of years of U.N. Security Council resolutions, with bellicose rhetoric coming from both Pyongyang and the White House. In November, North Korea demanded a halt to what it called brutal sanctions , saying a round imposed after its sixth and most powerful nuclear test on Sept. 3 constituted genocide. North Korea on Nov. 29 said it successfully tested a new ICBM that put the U.S. mainland within range of its nuclear weapons. U.S. diplomats have made clear they are seeking a diplomatic solution but proposed the new, tougher sanctions resolution to ratchet up pressure on North Korea s leader. China, with which North Korea does some 90 percent of its trade, has repeatedly called for calm and restraint from all sides and for a return to talks.",1,fakenewsnet,,China calls for constructive efforts to ease Korean tensions

"Today, several Democracy Spring protesters were arrested at the US Capitol. The protest appears to have broken the record for the number of people arrested at the US Capitol, reported Reuters.Thousands of people concerned about the widespread corruption in politics due to big money interests, voter suppression, and dysfunction in Congress participated in the protests, which began ten days ago at the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia. Organizations such as Greenpeace, the AFL-CIO, NAACP, and the National Nurses Union were part of a coalition of organizations participating in the protests. People are fed up with the system, they are fed up with the corruption, and we want free and fair elections, Cenk Uygur, host of the TV show Young Turks and one of the participants in the protest, told Reuters in an interview. This is our core American right. The fight begins today. It doesn t mean we win today. But in the end, we always win, Uygur said. Progressives have never lost. We won in civil rights, we won in women s rights, we won in gay rights, and we re going to win in getting our democracy back. The protest organizers are pushing Congress to pass four bills: Government by the People Act, Fair Elections Now Act, the Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2015 & Voter Empowerment Act of 2015, and the Democracy for All Amendment. The massive sit-in protest was peaceful, but buses were brought in to transport the activists who were arrested for demonstrating. Most media outlets have not covered the protests at all, and conservative media outlets have alleged the protests are just a re-branded version of the Occupy movement, which is false. Democracy Spring is being organized and run by well-educated individuals from various large and well-respected progressive organizations.

"KABUL (Reuters) - The Afghan Taliban said on Monday that Kevin King, one of two professors from the American University of Afghanistan who were kidnapped in Kabul last year, is seriously ill and needs urgent medical attention. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said King, an American, was suffering from dangerous heart disease and kidney problems. His illness has intensified, his feet have swollen and sometimes he becomes unconscious and his condition worsens every day, Mujahid said in a statement. We have tried to treat him time to time but we do not have medical facilities as we are in a war situation, he said. The U.S. State Department called for the immediate and unconditional release of King and other hostages. King and his Australian colleague Timothy Weeks were kidnapped in August 2016 as they were returning to their compound in the Afghan capital. Afghan and Western officials believe the men are being held by the Haqqani network, a militant group affiliated with the Taliban that has carried out many other kidnappings. They acknowledge that an unsuccessful rescue attempt was made in eastern Afghanistan months after the two were taken. The Taliban statement came around two weeks after Pakistani troops rescued Canadian Joshua Boyle and his American wife Caitlan Coleman from an area near the Afghan border. They had been held by the Haqqanis since being kidnapped in 2012. Earlier this year, the Taliban released a video of King and Weeks showing them pleading with their governments to release Taliban prisoners in turn for their freedom. Kidnapping high profile targets has become a lucrative business for the Taliban and other militant groups in Afghanistan who in return often demand huge ransom or release of their members.",1,fakenewsnet,,Afghan Taliban say kidnapped U.S. professor is seriously ill

"MOSCOW/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States provided intelligence to Russia that helped thwart a potentially deadly bomb attack in St. Petersburg, U.S. and Russian officials said on Sunday, in a rare public show of cooperation despite deep strains between the two countries. Russian President Vladimir Putin telephoned U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday to thank him for the tip-off, which the Kremlin said helped prevent a militant bomb attack on a cathedral in the Russian city, as well as other sites. The White House did not disclose details about the plot itself, but said the attack could have killed large numbers of people. Neither the Kremlin nor the White House identified the would-be attackers. The U.S. warning allowed Russian law enforcement agencies to arrest the suspects before they could carry out their plans, the White House and Kremlin said. Relations between Washington and Moscow have been damaged by disagreements over the wars in Ukraine and Syria, although Trump pledged during his election campaign to pursue better ties with Moscow. That has been complicated by U.S. allegations - denied by Russia - that the Kremlin meddled in last year s U.S. presidential election to help Trump win. Russian officials say Putin believes Trump is not to blame for the tensions. The phone call on Sunday between Trump and Putin was at least the second such call in the past week. On Thursday, Putin and Trump discussed the crisis in North Korea. The foiled attack was to have been carried out on Kazansky Cathedral, in Russia s second city of St. Petersburg, and on other locations in the city where large numbers of people gather, the Kremlin statement said. The cathedral is a popular tourist site. The White House seized on the foiled plot in St. Petersburg as a sign of what Moscow and Washington could do if they cooperate. Both leaders agreed that this serves as an example of the positive things that can occur when our countries work together, the White House said, adding Trump appreciated the call from Putin. Russian media reported last week that the Federal Security Service had detained followers of the Islamic State group who had been planning a suicide bomb attack on Kazansky Cathedral on Saturday. The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence did not immediately respond to requests for additional details on the foiled plot. Putin said Russia would alert U.S. authorities if it received information about any attack being planned on the United States, the Kremlin said. Russia has repeatedly been the target of attacks by Islamist militant groups, including an attack in April that killed 14 people when an explosion tore through a train carriage in a metro tunnel in St. Petersburg. Russian police detained several suspects in that attack from mainly Muslim states in ex-Soviet central Asia.",1,fakenewsnet,,"U.S. helped thwart major attack in St. Petersburg: U.S., Russia say"

"America got i s first true glimpse of a Trump presidency on the final night of the RNC. Instead of a speech focused on the economy and bringing back jobs to the United States, the charade delivered by the Republican presidential candidate was filled with hate and fear, resembling an almost Nixon-esque rhetoric not seen in almost fifty years.The nation needs to wake up. Luckily, we have Elizabeth Warren to help us do that.While appearing on CBS Late Night with Stephen Colbert immediately following Trump s speech, Warren (who has been rumored as a potential VP choice for Hillary Clinton), slammed the Republican candidate for sounding like a two-bit dictator and chided him for his divisive rhetoric: What Donald Trump says is there s a problem out there and what you have to understand is that it s all about each other. What you need to be afraid of is every other American. I ve got to tell you, that speech tonight, he sounded like some two-bit dictator of some country that you couldn t find on a map. Through the applause and a hilarious defense of Trump from Colbert, Warren doubled down: He sounded like a dictator of a small country rather than a man who is running for the highest office of the strongest democracy on the face of the earth. That s what he sounded like. And just like that, Elizabeth Warren summed up exactly how we all feel. To put it plainly, as Warren did, Donald Trump is a bad guy. Elizabeth Warren has been a special thorn in Donald Trump s side. No one, not the media or even Hillary Clinton, has gotten under Trump s skin more than she has. An attack dog in her own right, Warren has been absolutely spot on in her criticism of the potential fascist-in-chief: he s a thin skinned, dictating fraud.We learned earlier this week that Trump has no plan to actually take on the domestic or foreign roles needed to make a great president. That s what Mike Pence will be for.Hopefully Warren will reiterate her observations come the Democratic National Convention, where substance (not just venom) will be front and center for the whole country, and indeed the whole world, to see.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",0,fakenewsnet,," Elizabeth Warren Calls Trump A ‘Two-Bit Dictator,’ Slams His RNC Speech"

"(Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp said its Chief Executive Marillyn Hewson gave U.S. President-elect Donald Trump a personal commitment to bring down the price of its F-35 fighter jet, after he heaped pressure on the aerospace company over the cost. Lockheed’s shares fell on Friday after Trump’s message on Twitter, and after he earlier tweeted that he had asked rival Boeing Co to “price-out” an older aircraft as an alternative. Hewson said in a statement tweeted by Lockheed that the company would “aggressively” drive down the cost of the F-35, which brought in about 20 percent of Lockheed’s sales last year. Trump’s transition team did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Frequent breakdowns of advanced uranium enrichment devices have inadvertently helped Iran comply with restrictions in the international agreement curbing its nuclear program, according to a new report by a Washington-based think tank. Iranian compliance also is due to tougher policing by U.S. President Donald Trump s administration of the 2015 pact to prevent Tehran from developing nuclear weapons, the Institute for Science and International Security said in a report due on Friday. A copy of the report was seen by Reuters. Iran can be expected to continue to push the deal s limits, commit violations and seek interpretations that are unfounded, the report said. One should expect many struggles to keep Iran within the nuclear limits for the duration of the deal. For those reasons and because Tehran is unlikely ever to build a financially viable uranium enrichment plant, an expansion of Iran s program would either be a colossal waste of money ... or the basis of a nuclear weapons program, which would not care about costs, the report said. Washington and its negotiating partners in the agreement should find a way to make the deal s restrictions permanent or severely extend their expiration times, it said. Under the deal between Iran, Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States, Tehran agreed to restrict its nuclear program in return for the lifting of economic sanctions that had crippled its economy. The report comes as Trump weighs whether to certify to Congress that Iran is complying with the agreement. He has until Oct. 16 to make that decision. Decertifying Iran could lead Congress to reimpose U.S. sanctions on Iran, threatening to collapse the deal and intensify tension in the Middle East. Supporters of the deal, called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, insist that strong international monitoring will prevent Iran from developing nuclear bombs. Iran has denied that it is seeking nuclear weapons. The International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors the pact, has found no material breaches by Iran, a judgment with which Washington has concurred. Tehran has exceeded some deal restrictions, such as a limit on its heavy water stockpile, used in nuclear reactors, the Institute for Science and International Security said in a November 2016 report. But it either rectified some infractions or won exemptions - while President Barack Obama was in office - before the pact took effect in January 2016. In its new report the institute listed other alleged Iran compliance issues, including changes to the design of a heavy water reactor that can produce plutonium, another weapons fuel. Iran s improved compliance this year in part has been unintentional or accidental because advanced uranium enrichment devices called centrifuges have broken during testing more often than expected, according to the think tank report. Enrichment produces low-enriched uranium for power plants, but it also can make highly enriched weapons-grade uranium. By August, Iran had tested eight advanced IR-8 centrifuges although the deal limits it to one at most, the report said, adding that Iran also operated between 13 and 15 interconnected IR-6 machines, which the deal restricts to 10. However, according to the report, all but one of the IR-8s and many of the IR-6s broke because carbon fiber components failed. David Albright, a former U.N. nuclear inspector who authored the new report, said Iran s compliance also had improved because the United States is taking a tougher line on attempts to violate the nuclear limits and exploit loopholes. Two sources, including a senior U.S. official, said on Wednesday that the White House does not want to kill the deal. Instead, it wants lawmakers to hold off taking action while it discusses with European allies making the limits on Iran s program permanent and fixing what U.S. officials consider other flaws, said the sources, who requested anonymity.",1,fakenewsnet,,Exclusive: Faulty devices help keep Iran in nuclear deal limits - report

"PRAGUE (Reuters) - Czech billionaire Andrej Babis s ANO party met an anti-European Union, anti-immigration group on Thursday in search of a coalition partner as it struggles to convert a huge election win into a majority government. ANO won three times the votes of its nearest rival in last weekend s election that saw a popular swing from mainstream traditional parties towards outsiders, echoing a recent shift in Europe in favor of anti-establishment groups. But with Babis facing potential fraud charges, which he denies, most parties have ruled out any tie-up with ANO although it won over many voters with pledges to run the state like a business and weed out political corruption. The post-election limbo raises the risk that the 2018 state budget might not be approved within the deadline of year-end and kept open the possibility that ANO could opt for minority rule supported by far-left and far-right factions. On Thursday, ANO met the Freedom and Direct Democracy (SPD) party, which won 22 seats to ANO s 78. ANO has so far ruled out a block with the SPD but the two have found common ground on curbing immigration, a referendum law and welfare reform. ANO deputy chief Jaroslav Faltynek declined to say whether it would seek SPD support in a coalition or for a minority government. We have not spoken with the SPD about a government today. We issued a clear stance, even before the election, that we would not form a government either with SPD or KSCM (Communists), he told reporters. Police are looking into whether Babis hid ownership of a convention centre that received a 2 million-euro EU subsidy in 2008 though it was intended for small businesses. He says the investigation was part of efforts to push him from politics. Babis has called single-party government unrealistic and says he aims to have a coalition by Christmas. He has been talking to the Social Democrats and Christian Democrats, ANO s partners in the outgoing government, the SPD, Communists, conservative Civic Democrats and the liberal Pirates. Turning to the SPD could raise eyebrows in Brussels as the party has demanded a referendum on membership in the EU, a risky move in the eurosceptic-leaning country of 10.6 million people.",1,fakenewsnet,,Czech election winner Babis meets anti-EU party in hunt for viable government

"TOKYO (Reuters) - Emperor Akihito, who has spent much of his nearly three decades on Japan s throne seeking to soothe the wounds of World War Two, will step down on April 30, 2019 - the first abdication by a Japanese monarch in about two centuries. A 10-member Imperial Household Council of lawmakers, royals and supreme court justices, chaired by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, agreed on the timing on Friday. Akihito, who turns 84 on Dec. 23 and has had heart surgery and treatment for prostate cancer, said in rare remarks last year that he feared age might make it hard for him to fulfil his duties. He will be succeeded by his heir, 57-year-old Crown Prince Naruhito. This is the first abdication by an emperor in 200 years and the first under the (post-war) constitution, Abe told reporters after announcing the recommendation. I feel deep emotion that today, the opinion of the Imperial Household Council was smoothly decided and a big step was taken toward the imperial succession. The cabinet still has to sign off on the decision on the date, which it will likely do next week. Once considered divine, Japan s emperor is defined in the post-war constitution as a symbol of the state and of the unity of the people , but has no political power. Akihito, along with Empress Michiko, has spent much time trying to address the legacy of World War Two, which was fought in the name of his father Hirohito, and consoling victims of disasters or other woes. He is widely respected by average Japanese. Both the emperor and empress thought tirelessly about the people, said Taeko Ito, a 72-year-old caregiver. Now he is elderly and I wish from my heart that he can have a rest. Akihito and Michiko, the first commoner to wed a Japanese monarch, have worked to reconcile ties across Asia, soured by Japan s aggression before and during World War Two, with numerous visits abroad. In 1992, he became the first Japanese monarch in living memory to visit China, where bitter memories of the war run deep. During that visit the emperor said he deeply deplored an unfortunate period in which my country inflicted great suffering on the people of China . Akihito has consistently urged the Japanese never to forget the horrors of war, remarks that have garnered increased attention since Abe took office in 2012 and sought to adopt a less apologetic tone over Japan s past military aggression. He redefined the job. He wanted to modernise the monarchy and take care of the unfinished business ... and bring the imperial household closer to the people, said Jeffrey Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University Japan. He s been remarkably successful on all fronts. He is deeply admired and respected. His moral authority is unquestioned. Once Akihito steps down a new imperial era will begin, replacing the current Heisei or achieving peace period which began on Jan. 8, 1989, the day he took the throne. Japan uses the Western-style Gregorian calendar but has also preserved the ancient custom in which the reign of a new emperor ushers in a new era. The last time a Japanese emperor abdicated was in 1817. Post-war law had not allowed for abdication, so a one-off law was adopted in June to let Akihito step down, but it left details such as the timing to be worked out. An early proposal that he retire at the end of 2018, his 30th year on the throne, was rejected over worries it would conflict with rituals and other duties around then. Another date considered was March 31, 2019, the end of the business year. But subsequent ceremonies would have coincided with a busy time for many people and nation-wide local elections in early April, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said. Some Japanese lamented that the process was taking too long. It s the same for me - life is not so long, said a 79-year-old retiree, Asataro Nishizawa. They should have granted his wish sooner, while he is still vigorous. The abdication law did not address the problem of the future of an ageing, shrinking imperial family and the related issue of whether women should be allowed to ascend the throne. Eleven-year-old Prince Hisahito, the son of Akihito s younger son Prince Akishino, is the emperor s only grandson and will be second in line to the throne after his father following the abdication. Naruhito s daughter, Princess Aiko, who turned 16 on Friday, cannot inherit the males-only throne.",1,fakenewsnet,,"Japan's Emperor Akihito to abdicate on April 30, 2019"

"On Sunday, Iran executed a nuclear scientist for giving vital information to the enemy. Shahram Amiri disappeared in 2009 during a trip to Mecca in Saudi Arabia. For a year he was missing, but then resurfaced in the United States in June of 2010. Amiri says that he had been kidnapped by the CIA and put under intense psychological pressure to reveal sensitive information. He claims that he rejected the United States efforts to break him, but the U.S. Government said at the time that Amiri had defected voluntarily, and had been paid millions of dollars for useful information related to the country s nuclear program.The next month, he appeared in Washington DC at the Iranian interests section of Pakistan s embassy, seeking to return to Iran.Days later, he obtained passage home, where he originally received a hero s welcome. But in May of 2011, he was arrested and tried for treason. Though his family believed he had been given ten years in prison, which would have made him eligible for release in 2022, he was actually sentenced to death. Finally, his execution was carried out on August 7, 2016. Amiri had access to confidential military secrets and was connected to our No. 1 enemy, the Great Satan, Islamic Republic of Iran spokesman Gholamhosein Mohseni-Ejei said in his weekly news conference. He was sentenced to death in primary court, and the sentence was confirmed by Supreme Court after Amiri appealed the decision. The CIA thought that its movements were kept away from the eye of Iranian Intelligence Ministry, Mohseni-Ejei said. They took Amiri to Saudi Arabia. To most, this seems fairly standard. He released video informing his country that he betrayed their national secrets to the CIA, the United States confirmed that he had done so, and for some reason he thought it was safe to return home. This is documented history unless, of course, you re Tom Cotton.You see, Amiri was mentioned in recently-released Clinton emails. According to Cotton, the messages, which did not become public until very recently, were the cause of Amiri s 2011 arrest and death sentence. We have a diplomatic, psychological issue, not a legal one. Our friend has to be given a way out, Richard Morningstar, a former State Department special envoy for Eurasian energy, wrote nine days before he returned to Iran. Our person won t be able to do anything anyway. If he has to leave so be it. On Face the Nation, Cotton tossed a thick layer of blame on Clinton: I m not going to comment on what he may or may not have done for the United States government, but in the emails that were on Hillary Clinton s private server, there were conversations among her senior advisors about this gentleman. That goes to show just how reckless and careless her decision was to put that kind of highly classified information on a private server. And I think her judgment is not suited to keep this country safe, Cotton added, apparently forgetting that all of this happened years before her emails were released.In fact, the timing doesn t seem to matter to anyone on the right wing. Gateway Pundit s Jim Hoft, more commonly known as the stupidest man on the internet (seriously, Google it), declared that Clinton s unprotected emails got [an] Iranian nuclear scientist executed. They found out he was working for the US thanks to Hillary Clinton s emails, Hoft writes. Nice work, Hillary.

"Someone had to say it. Okay, liberals have been saying it for years. Fox News (and increasingly, the other news channels) have been promoting fear for so long that they have become the terrorists. Pope Francis agrees. Channeling Franklin Delano Roosevelt s infamous line, we have nothing to fear but fear itself, the Pope chastised fear-based media.Journalism based on gossip or rumors is a form of terrorism and media that stereotype entire populations or foment fear of migrants are acting destructively, Pope Francis said on Thursday.Spreading rumors is an example of terrorism, of how you can kill a person with your tongue , he said. This is even more true for journalists because their voice can reach everyone and this is a very powerful weapon. Source: ReutersNow, to be fair, Pope Francis was in Italy and he was talking to Italy s press, which has its own problems with nationalism, but I m sure he was hoping his words would hop the pond. After all, Fox spreads little but fear and that s what has given us Donald Trump.Crime in the nation is down. An American s odds of being killed by a terrorist is 1 in 20 million. Those are roughly the same odds as being killed by your own furniture. Still, Trump, prompted on by Fox News, is scaring the crap out of Americans:Fear is in the air, and fear is surging. Americans are more afraid today than they have been in a long time: Polls show majorities of Americans worried about being victims of terrorism and crime, numbers that have surged over the past year to highs not seen for more than a decade. Every week seems to bring a new large- or small-scale terrorist attack, at home or abroad. Mass shootings form a constant drumbeat. Protests have shut down large cities repeatedly, and some have turned violent. Overall crime rates may be down, but a sense of disorder is constant.Source: The AtlanticSure, that s about Donald Trump and the Pope wasn t directly talking about him, but Fox is the fear network.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Republicans expect to introduce bills later this week that would bar states from setting their own rules for self-driving cars and take other steps to remove obstacles to putting such vehicles on the road, a spokeswoman said. The legislative action comes as major automakers are joining forces with auto suppliers and other groups to prod Congress into action. Last month, a U.S. House of Representatives Energy and Commerce subcommittee held a hearing on a Republican draft package of 14 bills that would allow U.S. regulators to exempt up to 100,000 vehicles a year per manufacturer from federal motor vehicle safety rules that prevent the sale of self-driving vehicles without human controls. Blair Ellis, a spokeswoman for the committee, said on Monday it was likely that legislation would be introduced this week and a formal hearing on the bills would occur next week. Republican U.S. Representative Robert Latta said last month he hoped to win committee approval of a bipartisan legislative package by the end of July. The draft measures would bar states from setting self-driving rules and prevent the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration from pre-approving self-driving car technologies. Democrats say the NHTSA must play a more aggressive role in mandating self-driving car safety. The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a group representing General Motors Co (GM.N), Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) and others, and the Association of Global Automakers, representing major foreign automakers including Honda Motor Co (7267.T) and Hyundai Motor Corp (005380.KS), are forming the Coalition for Future Mobility to press Congress to act. The group, which includes the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association, National Federation of the Blind and Securing America’s Future Energy, a group of corporate officials and retired military leaders, plans to begin airing radio ads on Tuesday portraying the legislation as “liberating innovation for self-driving vehicles.” GM, Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and others have been lobbying Congress to pre-empt rules under consideration in California and other states that could limit self-driving vehicle deployment. The administration of former Democratic President Barack Obama last year unveiled voluntary guidelines on self-driving cars.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate will vote to renew sanctions on Iran for 10 years before adjourning next month, the chamber’s Republican leader said on Wednesday, sending the bill to the White House, where President Barack Obama is expected to sign it into law. The House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday for the decade-long extension of the Iran Sanctions Act, or ISA, first adopted in 1996 to punish investments in Iran’s energy industry and deter the country’s pursuit of nuclear weapons. The act will expire at the end of 2016 if it is not renewed. “We’re going to take up the House bill,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters at the Senate’s weekly Republican leadership news conference. “... And we’re going to pass it.” The Obama administration and other world powers reached an agreement last year in which Tehran agreed to curb its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. But members of Congress said they wanted the ISA to stay in effect to send a strong message that the United States will respond to provocations by Iran and give any U.S. president the ability to quickly reinstate sanctions if Tehran violated the nuclear agreement. White House officials have said they did not think the reinstatement was needed, now that the nuclear agreement has been in effect for almost a year. But they also have not raised concerns that a renewal would violate the deal. Apart from the ISA, the nuclear agreement’s longer-term future became more uncertain when Republican Donald Trump was elected president on Nov. 8, and Republicans kept their majorities in both the Senate and House of Representatives. Every Republican in Congress opposed the nuclear agreement. And Trump was harshly critical of it as he campaigned.",1,fakenewsnet,,U.S. Senate leader says Iran sanctions renewal will pass
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Executives from Facebook, Alphabet Inc’s Google and Twitter have been asked to testify to the U.S. Congress in coming weeks as lawmakers probe Russia’s alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. election, committee sources said on Wednesday. A Senate aide said executives from the three firms had been asked by the Senate Intelligence Committee to appear at a public hearing on Nov. 1. The leaders of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee said the panel would hold an open hearing next month with representatives from unnamed technology companies in an effort to “better understand how Russia used online tools and platforms to sow discord in and influence our election.” Representatives for Facebook and Google confirmed they had received invitations from the Senate committee but did not say whether the companies would attend. Twitter did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The House panel did not immediately identify any companies, but a committee source said lawmakers expected to hear from the same three firms the Senate had asked to testify. The requests are the latest move by congressional investigators to gain information from internet companies as they probe the extent of Moscow’s alleged efforts to disrupt last year’s U.S. election. Lawmakers in both parties have grown increasingly concerned that social networks may have played a key role in Russia’s influence operation. Facebook revealed this month that suspected Russian trolls purchased more than $100,000 worth of divisive ads on its platform during the 2016 election cycle, a revelation that has prompted calls from some Democrats for new disclosure rules for online political ads. On Wednesday, Trump attacked Facebook in a tweet and suggested the world’s largest social network had colluded with other media outlets that opposed him. The president has been skeptical of the conclusions of U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the election and has denied his campaign colluded with Moscow. The salvo prompted a lengthy rebuke from Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, who said both Trump and liberals were upset about ideas and content on Facebook during the campaign. “That’s what running a platform for all ideas looks like,” Zuckerberg wrote on his personal Facebook page. Other internet firms besides Facebook are also facing rising scrutiny over how Russia may have leveraged their platforms. Twitter is expected to privately brief the Senate panel on Thursday. Republican Senator James Lankford, who has received classified information about Russia’s interference as a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on Wednesday that the country’s attempts to sow discord in U.S. domestic affairs had not abated. Russian internet trolls over the weekend fueled the debate ignited by Trump over whether NFL players should have the right to kneel during the national anthem, Lankford said. Also on Wednesday, the Daily Beast, citing unnamed sources, reported that a Facebook group named “United Muslims of America” was a fake account linked to the Russian government and that it was used to push false claims about U.S. politicians, including Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. The group bought Facebook ads to reach targeted audiences, promoting political rallies aimed at Muslims, the website reported. The Senate and House intelligence committees are two of the main congressional panels probing allegations that Russia sought to interfere in the U.S. election to boost Trump’s chances at winning the White House, and possible collusion between Trump associates and Russia.",1,fakenewsnet,,"Facebook, Google, Twitter asked to testify on Russian meddling"

"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Soon after the United States imposed sanctions on Moscow in 2014, Russian oil tsar Igor Sechin told a Reuters reporter he would miss three things: exploring U.S. culture, the chance to show his children American landscapes, and riding motor-bikes with Exxon Mobil chief executive Rex Tillerson. Tillerson is now front-runner to be Secretary of State in the cabinet of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, and Russian officials are relishing the prospect of having someone with long-standing ties to Russia as the chief U.S. diplomat. Those same ties — Tillerson has met Russian President Vladimir Putin several times and even received a medal from him — are causing disquiet among some policymakers in Washington, who see the relationships as a potential liability. Few people in Moscow expect that the bitter rifts with Washington, over Syria, Ukraine, and NATO’s presence in eastern Europe, will be healed overnight with Tillerson at the State Department. But his emergence as front-runner for the job was seen in Moscow as confirmation the Trump administration would put aside old enmity and do deals with the Kremlin. Trump is expected to name Tillerson, a 64-year-old Texan, as Secretary of State, a source familiar with the situation said on Saturday. Tillerson would join other figures with Russia ties already in the Trump cabinet. “The choice of Tillerson is a sensation,” said Alexei Pushkov, a pro-Kremlin lawmaker in the upper house of the Russian parliament. “This is a businessmen, by definition a pragmatist, who also has lots of experience working with Russia.” “Judging by the appointments to the key posts in the administration, Trump wants to see a decisive and strong America, but does not see reasons for conflicts with Russia,” Pushkov wrote on Twitter. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was cautious on Tillerson’s cabinet prospects, saying the appointment had not been confirmed. But he praised his personal qualities. “As part of his duties as head of one of the biggest oil companies, he had contacts with our representatives,” Peskov, said on a conference call with reporters. “He carries out his duties in a highly professional way.” Asked about how close Tillerson is to Putin, Peskov said: “They had working meetings. Indeed, the president received Mr. Tillerson several times.” Though he and Putin know each other, the most important relationship Tillerson forged in Russia is with Sechin, one of Putin’s closest lieutenants. Tillerson started coming into regular contact with Russian officials when, in January 1998, he was made vice president of an Exxon unit involved in exploration projects in Russia and the former Soviet Union. The flagship project was the Sakhalin 1 offshore project in the Pacific Ocean. Exxon was the operator and Rosneft, the Russian state oil giant headed by Sechin, was a major shareholder. “He knows this whole sphere excellently,” said an oil executive close to Rosneft and Exxon, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “He was involved in the negotiations and the implementation of Sakhalin 1.. From the start. And he knows the peculiarities of the Russian mind-set very well.” In 2012, Rosneft and Exxon deepened their cooperation, signing an agreement on joint development of oil fields in Western Siberia. Putin, Tillerson and Sechin came together for the signing ceremony. Later the same year Zeljko Runje, who until then had been vice president of Exxon’s Russian operations, moved to Rosneft to take up the post of vice president and member of the management board. Their next big joint project was launched in June 2013, when they set up a joint venture to explore for oil in the Kara Sea, in the Arctic, and in the Black Sea. Sechin and Tillerson both attended the signing ceremony. In the same month, Putin awarded Tillerson the Order of Friendship, a Russian state honor. The citation said it was for his “significant contribution to strengthening cooperation in the energy sector.” Then the Ukraine conflict intervened in 2014, testing Tillerson’s relations with his Russian partners. After Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimea region and backed separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine, the United States started several rounds of sanctions. Tillerson, like other U.S. energy CEOs under pressure from the White House, stayed away from an annual investors’ meeting with Putin in St Petersburg in June. He sent a senior Exxon executive in his place. By August 2014, Exxon was poised to start drilling on the Kara Sea’s Universitetskaya exploratory well but an imminent fresh round of sanctions could have halted work. According to two offshore drilling sources familiar with the Kara Sea project, Tillerson and his team went into crisis mode. They managed to sign the contract to supply a drilling rig just before one round of sanctions was imposed, giving them some legal breathing space. The Exxon managers then pushed through the drilling program in two months before a further round of sanctions eventually knocked it off course, the sources said. They found large reserves of crude. An Exxon representative was not immediately available for comment. Soon after, obstacles arising from the sanctions forced Exxon to suspend its cooperation with Rosneft in the Kara Sea. The project has since been idling. But Exxon’s Russian partners remember its effort to get the well drilled. “I think his appointment is favorable for Russia,” one of the two sources said about Tillerson being lined up for Secretary of State.",1,fakenewsnet,,"Russia sees Exxon boss, tipped to be Secretary of State, as an old friend"

"Ben Shapiro debates two students on when a baby becomes a human being. A hot topic that stumps pro-choice people but not pro-lifers: I believe, as do most people who feel this way about abortion, that life begins at conception. When sperm meets egg, and the child is conceived, that s when life begins; that is what I believe in. Ben Shapiro It s my body. How about you stay out of it? the student replied. I don t care about your appendix, Shapiro quipped, referencing the student s earlier argument. I don t even care about your uterus. I care about what s in it. And I can take out my appendix if I don t want it. So why can t I take out other parts of my body? the student asked. Because they are not independent living human beings, Shapiro fired back.The student continued to engage in a debate, arguing the fetus is merely a bundle of cells. At what point does that bundle of cells become a human being in your judgement? Shapiro asked her. Um , the student said.Another student chimed in. The concept of body autonomy means that I don t have to give up any part of my body unless I say so, she said. The baby is not part of your body, Shapiro quipped.In general, the fear of calling a baby a baby within progressive circles is an entertaining spectacle, given the amount of intellectual gymnastics that are involved, which almost always ends with some disingenuous conclusion that a woman s life holds more value than that of her child barring any life threatening conditions, or the pro-abortion supporter storming out because folks, like Shapiro, totally own them on the issue. In other words, they feel triggered, so off to the safe space, where like-minded people can sulk and discuss how the patriarchy sucks, or something.Yet, one thing is clear in this exchange, which is that Shapiro is open to debate, and he wants to discuss these issues in which conservatives find themselves in the crosshairs of political correctness in campuses across the country. After going back and forth about the science relating to pregnancy, it becomes clear that the pro-choice wing of the attendees in the room are exasperated to the point where they accuse Shapiro of trying to shut them down; Shapiro aptly noted that he allowed them to speak for almost ten minutes on the subject. Another student asked Shapiro what criteria does he have regarding what defines a life, but then made an aberrant pivot by asking him of he considers semen to be a life, insinuating that Shapiro masturbates a lot because he s a human being (no, I m not making that part up). Well put, sir, said Shapiro, which drew laughter from the audience. I believe, as do most people who feel this way about abortion, that life begins at conception. When sperm meets egg, and the child is conceived, that s when life begins; that is what I believe in. The rest of the question was weird, he added.Indeed, sir.Via: Hot Air",0,fakenewsnet,,HOT TOPIC: When Exactly Does A ‘Bundle Of Cells’ Become A Human Being? [Video]

"Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) has been worried about the mayhem Donald Trump was going to subject the GOP to since the very start of his campaign, and now that Trump is failing miserably in the polls, Graham is afraid the Republican Party could lose the majority in the U.S. Senate.According to a New York Times article, Graham unleashed on Trump, who he says is in a self-created death spiral and continues to bring the GOP down with him. Graham, who is not supporting Trump, said: People are getting pretty nervous about our candidates because he s in a death spiral here and nobody knows where the bottom is at. And although Trump is choosing to live in denial about the fact that Hillary Clinton is leading him by so much that it would be nearly impossible for Republican candidates to survive, Graham is well aware of what is at stake. However, Graham says that it might be dangerous for the GOP to disavow Trump this far into the presidential race because it might discourage conservatives from showing up at the polls at all. Graham said: It s going to be like Weekend at Bernie s you got to make him look alive, even if he s not. After Trump had a few weeks of spewing some of the most offensive, controversial comments he d ever made, the presidential nominee made some massive changes to his campaign, although it s probably too late. Earlier this week, Graham said that Trump had alienated voters so much that he stands no chance against Clinton in November, no matter what he does. Graham said: Mitt Romney got 27 percent of the Hispanic vote. By 2050, a majority of the country will be African-American, Hispanic, Asian and others, and we re losing demographically. We ve gone from 44 percent with Bush to 27 percent with Romney, and I don t think Donald Trump s gonna get 20 percent. Graham s right. Currently, Trump is only polling at 2% with African American voters and don t expect the Hispanic population, whom Trump offended several times earlier this year, to be any more promising. Trump has single-handedly destroyed the GOP, and Graham knows it may never fully recover.Featured image via Justin Sullivan / Getty Images",0,fakenewsnet,," Republican Lindsey Graham LOSES IT, Blames Trump For GOP’s ‘Death Spiral’"

"GENEVA (Reuters) - A break-in at the U.N. human rights office in Burundi s capital may have been an attempt to smear the government, a presidential aide told reporters on Friday in Geneva. U.N. staff in Burundi filed a complaint with police after a group of armed men broke into the office in Bujumbura at around 2.30 a.m. on Wednesday, a U.N. spokeswoman said. Nobody was hurt and there was no damage in the attack, which came a week after a U.N. human rights inquiry said Burundian officials at the highest level should be held accountable for crimes against humanity. Willy Nyamitwe, senior communications officer in the office of the president, said the two guards at the office had been arrested and it was probably not a simple burglary. What the police have already said is apparently there was no attack coming from the outside, which certainly means the guards would seem to be complicit. But ... we should wait for the final conclusions of this investigation. Nyamitwe is expected to respond to the allegations at the U.N. Human Rights Council next week. Burundi has rejected the findings of the U.N. inquiry, which Nyamitwe said was a puppet of the European Union. U.N. human rights spokeswoman Elizabeth Throssell called for an investigation of the break-in that complied with international legal procedures.",1,fakenewsnet,,Burundi says U.N. office break-in may have been fabrication

"The hate for the Trump family by the defeated liberal press is visceral MSNBC political analyst Joan Walsh, a self-proclaimed feminist, questioned what message Ivanka Trump was trying to send at the G20 Summit by wearing a pink girly dress with bows.Walsh suggested that the dress Trump chose when sitting in for her father at the summit made her look like property and undermined her own value. I don t mean to sound sexist, it can be dangerous to comment on what women wear, but the fact that she sat in for her father in a dress that was so incredibly ornamental was such a contradiction, Walsh said. In patriarchal, authoritarian societies, daughters have great value. They are property. I think it s really pretty frightening, she continued. It s a pink dress with big bows on the elbows that s not a dress that s made for work. MSNBC host Thomas Roberts pushed back and asked if Walsh was suggesting that women can not dress in a feminine manner and be taken seriously. You can be a feminist and be girly, we all have our girly days, but showing up, taking your father s seat in a pink dress with big bows on the sleeves is a really interesting message, Walsh argued.

"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden’s Vattenfall will invest 3 billion Swedish crowns ($349 million) in a Scottish offshore wind farm that U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump tried to stop being built near his luxury golf course in Scotland. State-owned utility Vattenfall, which will take 100 percent ownership of the project from Aberdeen Renewable Energy Group, described its investment as a vote of confidence in Britain after the nation’s decision to leave the European Union. “The decision to invest ... comes only a few weeks after the British referendum on leaving the EU and demonstrates Vattenfall’s continuing long-term commitment to wind power in Great Britain,” the company said in a statement. Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said she would not rule out the possibility of Scotland remaining in the EU. Sturgeon said that a second independence referendum is now a possibility, though she has also emphasized that another vote would not take place until it is clear that most Scots are in favor of breaking from the United Kingdom. Vattenfall said the wind farm will have capacity of 92.4 megawatts, which could potentially supply about 130,000 households with energy. It will also serve as a center for testing and developing new technologies for offshore wind power. In December last year Britain’s top court threw out a bid by Trump to stop the 11-turbine wind farm from being built near his multimillion-dollar resort. The Trump Organization had denounced the Scottish government as “foolish, small minded and parochial”. The Scottish National Party’s foreign affairs spokesman Alex Salmond replied that Trump was “three times a loser”. Construction is expected to start in the latter part of 2017, with the wind farm expected to start generating electricity in spring 2018.

"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Austria s likely next chancellor assured European Union leaders on Thursday of his support for the EU, allaying concerns that his country would become a dissonant voice in the bloc with the far right expected to enter its government. Sebastian Kurz of the mainstream conservative OVP party won a parliamentary election on Sunday after campaigning on an anti-immigration platform, and a coalition with the far-right Freedom Party (FPO) is widely anticipated. Arriving at a meeting of conservative EU leaders, the 31-year-old Kurz said he would speak to all parties in the Austrian parliament before deciding on a governing partner. Any government I form will be a pro-European one, Kurz, who has been the Alpine republic s foreign minister since 2013, told reporters. I m not just glad we have this European Union, but I also see it as the responsibility of my younger generation to actively engage and shape the EU in a positive way. Kurz, who will not represent Austria at regular EU summits until he forms a government, also met European Council President Donald Tusk and European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker. Tusk, a former Polish prime minister, hailed Kurz on Twitter as a truly pro-European winner of the Austrian elections . Austria became a member of the European Union in 1995 after a two-thirds majority voted to join the bloc. Recent opinion polls show three-quarters of Austrians want the affluent country to remain a member of the EU. The FPO, which won over a quarter of Austria s vote to the conservatives nearly 32 percent, gained from public unease over a large influx of mostly Muslim migrants into Europe in 2015.

"The notion that millennials are stupid, spoiled, uninformed voters who only care about themselves was shredded today after a new poll from the Harvard Institute of Politics showed millennial voters would overwhelmingly back Hillary Clinton in a general election matchup with Donald Trump.Collecting responses from over three thousand 18-29 year old voters showed Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton would garner 60 percent to Trump s 25 percent, an astonishing 36 point lead, while 14 percent remain undecided.So, in other words, the selfish, uninformed, spoiled millennials wouldn t back the actual selfish, spoiled, uninformed Republican front-runner.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations will blast the world body over its treatment of Israel at her Senate confirmation hearing, according to prepared testimony seen by Reuters on Tuesday. “Nowhere has the UN’s failure been more consistent and more outrageous than in its bias against our close ally Israel,” Republican South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley said in the opening remarks for her appearance on Wednesday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “Any honest assessment also finds an institution that is often at odds with American national interests and American taxpayers,” the speech says. In the remarks, Haley offered some praise for UN activities, such as health and food programs that have saved millions of lives, weapons monitoring and some peacekeeping missions, in something of a departure from Trump, who has disparaged the United Nations. Other Trump national security nominees, notably his choices for Secretary of State, former Exxon Mobil Corp chairman Rex Tillerson, and Secretary of Defense, retired Marine General James Mattis, have also broken from the Republican president-elect in testimony before the Senate. Noting that the United States contributes 22 percent of the UN budget, far more than any other country, Haley asked, “Are we getting what we pay for?” She promised to work with U.S. lawmakers to pursue what she described as “seriously needed change” at the United Nations.

To please the powerful farm lobby that has two-fifths of the votes in the lower house, Temer agreed to lower fines for environmental damage. He attempted to relax a definition of slave labor but was forced to backtrack after an outcry. In the clearest move to favor an ally, the Republican Party that has 37 seats in the 512-seat chamber and runs the Transport Ministry, Temer removed Sao Paulo s busy and lucrative Congonhas airport from a list of airports to be privatized. The party has appointees in the ministry and state airport operator Infraero. Critics and political observers say Temer has sacrificed austerity policies to save his presidency but will emerge from Wednesday s vote a weakened leader unable to pass substantial measures, such as an overhaul of the pension system. Temer faces charges in a bribery case based on testimony by an owner of the world s largest meatpacker JBS SA that has implicated several of his cabinet ministers. The lower house decides whether a president should stand trial before the Supreme Court, which can only take place if two-thirds of deputies vote for it. He will survive because he has a majority, though not my vote because I believe there is enough evidence to put him on trial by the Supreme Court, said Fabio Sousa, a lawmaker of the centrist the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB), a member of Temer s governing coalition. Temer managed to block a first corruption charge in August. Now he faces charges of obstruction of justice and criminal organization for allegedly receiving bribes from JBS. Temer has met with dozens of lawmakers in recent days to secure their votes. Presidential aides said he hopes to widen his margin of support so that he can move ahead with his reforms, paralyzed for six months by the political crisis. Those votes come at a cost, in pork-barrel spending. According to public spending watchdog Contas Abertas, Temer fast-tracked spending in congressional districts worth 4.4 billion reais ($1.3 billion) to help win the first vote, and is now hitting the 2 billion real mark ahead of Wednesday s vote. O Globo newspaper estimated the cost of Temer s handouts to taxpayers at 12 billion reais, half of which would have come from the planned airport concession auction. Yet most analysts believe Temer will get less votes this time, because lawmakers have started to distance themselves from his government ahead of next year s general elections. After this vote, Temer will become a lame duck president. It will be very difficult for him to pass any reforms, said David Fleischer, politics professor emeritus at Brasilia University. Investors are waiting to see if Temer can deliver a pension reform to tackle a budget deficit that cost brazil its investment grade credit rating. If he does get social security reform approved, it will be badly watered down, Fleischer said.",1,fakenewsnet,,Brazil's Temer makes concessions to survive in office

"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Dozens of people were stopped from flying to the United States from Istanbul Ataturk Airport on Sunday, Turkish airport officials said, after U.S. President Donald Trump ordered a ban on refugees and nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries. In his most sweeping action since taking office, Trump on Friday put a four-month hold on allowing refugees into the United States and temporarily barred travelers from Syria, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. He said the moves would protect Americans from terrorism. Although NATO member Turkey is not on the list, Ataturk airport is a major regional hub frequently used by travelers from the Middle East heading to Europe or the United States. Officials at Ataturk, Europe’s third-busiest airport, told Reuters they had stopped “dozens” of people from traveling on Sunday, due to the ban. One official said the number was fewer than 80, but declined to give further details. One 32-year-old Syrian man, Nail Zain, told Reuters he arrived at the airport expecting to fly to Los Angeles, but officials prevented him from boarding, saying his visa was canceled. “My wife and my son are in the United States. My son has American nationality. And we have been waiting for this moment for two years. Finally when I got the chance, they prevented me as a Syrian passport holder from traveling,” Zain said. He was later taken out of the terminal by authorities. It was not immediately clear whether the ban would have an impact on flagship carrier Turkish Airlines. Officials for the airline were not immediately available to comment on Sunday. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said about 375 travelers had been affected by the order, 109 of whom were in transit and were denied entry to the United States. Another 173 were stopped by airlines before boarding.",1,fakenewsnet,,Dozens barred from flying out of Istanbul airport after Trump ban

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senior U.S. House of Representatives Republican Tom Cole said on Wednesday more funds will be needed to fight the Zika virus in the United States, signaling a shift from insistence by many Republicans that the Obama administration should use existing funds for the effort to combat the growing threat. The Zika outbreak began last year in Brazil and has spread rapidly through the Americas. U.S. officials say local outbreaks are possible in the United States, particularly in southern states like Florida and Texas where the mosquitoes that carry the virus are active. Democrats and Obama administration officials have been urging the Republican-controlled Congress to grant nearly $1.9 billion in emergency funds to fight the virus. In a temporary fix, the White House said last week that it would redirect $589 million in allocated funds to prepare for Zika’s arrival in the continental United States. Representative Cole, who chairs the health appropriations subcommittee, said the funds should last until the end of the government’s fiscal year on Sept. 30. “There’s going to need to be additional money, I don’t think there’s any doubt about that,” Cole told reporters after a House Republican meeting. “We’re having discussions about that now.” Republican Senator Marco Rubio, who is from Florida, broke with other congressional Republicans on Zika last week, announcing his support for President Barack Obama’s $1.9 billion request to fight the virus. On Wednesday, Rubio wrote to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to urge it to clear a backlog of Zika diagnostic tests and prioritize testing for pregnant women, saying he had seen media reports that some pregnant women have waited up to a month for CDC to complete their tests. The White House on Wednesday said a bill that passed on Tuesday was a positive first step in combating Zika but lamented its lack of additional funds needed to fight the virus, which has been linked to a rare birth defect in babies called microcephaly and neurological disorders in adults. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said he anticipated that President Barack Obama would sign the bill, which provides financial incentives to companies developing treatments for Zika. Cole said lawmakers have not decided whether any new money to fight Zika would be provided in an appropriations bill, or attached to a “continuing resolution” keeping the government open at current spending levels, if lawmakers end up passing such a measure later this year. “I think the problem is real, certainly there will need to be additional money at the NIH on this,” Cole said, referring to the National Institutes of Health. House Speaker Paul Ryan said, however, that if more money is needed to fight Zika, lawmakers will address the matter through the regular appropriations process. “We will address the situation through the regular appropriations process as the need arises, and our appropriators are looking at how to do just that,” Ryan said at a press conference.",1,fakenewsnet,,"Republican, signaling a shift, says more money needed for Zika fight"

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate may vote as soon as Tuesday on a bipartisan proposal that would make it easier to penalize operators of websites that facilitate online sex trafficking, according to four sources familiar with the matter. Allowing a vote on the legislation would deal a major blow to the U.S. technology industry, which has vigorously opposed the measure, saying it would thwart digital innovation and lead to endless litigation. The proposed law was prompted in part by frustrations over failed attempts to shut down the website backpage.com, which many law enforcement officials have accused of facilitating the exploitation of especially women and children to perform sexual services against their will. The company has long denied the allegations. The Senate is expected to pass an annual defense policy spending bill this week, a process that will include consideration of amendments, some of which have yet to be publicly disclosed. Among the amendments being considered is the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, which would change a section of a decades-old law that shields companies such as Facebook Inc, Amazon Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google from liability for content posted by their users, according to a Senate aide and three technology industry sources. The sources, who requested anonymity to discuss ongoing private conversations, cautioned on Monday that the situation was fluid and the Republican Senate leadership might decide against allowing a vote on the amendment. But they also said it was likely to pass if there was a vote, a possibility that has alarmed internet companies. The underlying defense bill is considered must-pass legislation but would need to be reconciled with the House of Representatives and signed by President Donald Trump before becoming law. Republican Senator Rob Portman introduced the online trafficking bill in August and has gained support from more than a fourth of the Senate. Kevin Smith, a spokesman for Portman, declined to comment, saying only that the senator was focused on building more support for the measure. The legislation would allow state attorneys general and victims of sex trafficking to pursue legal action against social media networks, advertisers and others who fail to keep exploitative material off their platforms. Technology companies say the changes to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act would impose impossible demands on online publishers and quash innovation. But some lawmakers and attorneys have argued that the statute has been too broadly interpreted to give companies too much leeway in avoiding responsibility for harmful content.",1,fakenewsnet,,US Senate may vote this week to add penalties for sex traffic sites -sources

"SEOUL (Reuters) - A North Korean border guard briefly crossed the border with the South in the chase for a defector last week - a violation of the ceasefire accord between North and South, a video released on Wednesday by the U.N. Command (UNC) in Seoul showed. The North Koreans were only steps behind the young man when they shot him at least four times as he made his escape on Nov. 13. The video, filmed as the defector drove an army truck through the demilitarized zone and then abandoned the vehicle, gives a dramatic insight into his escape. The defector, identified by a surgeon as a 24-year-old with the family name Oh, was flown by a U.S. military helicopter to a hospital in Suwon, south of Seoul. Doctors said he had regained consciousness, having had two operations to extract the bullets, and his breathing was stable and unassisted. He is fine, lead surgeon Lee Cook-Jong said at a news conference in Suwon. He is not going to die. A UNC official said North Korea had been informed on Wednesday that it had violated the 1953 armistice agreement, which marked the cessation of hostilities in the Korean War. The UNC official told a news conference that a soldier from the North Korean People s Army (KPA) had crossed the Military Demarcation Line (MDL), the border between the two Koreas, for a few seconds as others fired shots at the defecting soldier. The key findings of the special investigation team are that the KPA violated the armistice agreement by one, firing weapons across the MDL, and two, by actually crossing the MDL temporarily, Chad Carroll, Director of Public Affairs for the UNC, told reporters. The incident comes at a time of heightened tensions between North Korea and the international community over its nuclear weapons program, but Pyongyang has not publicly responded to the defection. The video, released by the UNC, was produced from surveillance cameras on the southern side of the the Joint Security Area (JSA) inside the demilitarized zone. When tree cover is too dense to see the wounded defector crawling across the border, it switches to infra-red. The film begins with a lone dark green army jeep speeding along empty, tree-lined roads toward the border. At one checkpoint, a North Korean guard marches impassively toward the approaching vehicle. It races by. He runs in pursuit. After passing a memorial to North Korea founder Kim Il Sung, where tourists often gather, the jeep runs into a ditch just meters from the border, which is not clearly marked. For several minutes the driver tries to free the vehicle, but the wheels spin uselessly in fallen leaves. The driver abandons the vehicle and sprints away, pushing tree branches out of his way and sending leaves flying. He scrambles up a slope to cross just seconds before more guards appear, shooting as they run. One slides into a pile of dead leaves to open fire before running forward and appearing to briefly cross the dividing line between the two countries. He quickly turns on his heel. The video does not show the moment the defector is hit, but he is seen lying in a pile of brush next to a concrete wall in a later edited clip. The UNC s Carroll said the position was still exposed to North Korean checkpoints across the border. Allied troops operating the cameras had by then notified their commanders and a quick reaction force had assembled on the South Korean side, according to Carroll. The video does not show this force. Infrared imagery shows two South Korean soldiers crawling through undergrowth to drag the wounded North Korean to safety, while the deputy commander of the border security unit oversees the rescue from a few meters away. Doctors have conducted a series of surgeries to remove four bullets from the critically wounded soldier, who arrived at the hospital having lost a large amount of blood. From a medical point of view he was almost dead when he was first brought here, said the surgeon, Lee. Hospital officials said the man remains in intensive care. The soldier showed signs of depression and possible trauma, in addition to a serious case of parasites that has complicated his treatment, the hospital said in a statement. Lee said last week one of the flesh-colored parasites he removed from the soldier s digestive tract was 27 cm (10.6 in) long. Continuing stress made the soldier hesitant to talk, but he had been cooperative, doctors said. The patient first recovered consciousness on Sunday, and asked where he was in South Korea, Lee said. He was in agony when he came to, the surgeon added. Since then doctors have played South Korean pop music for him, and American action movies including The Transporter from 2002. On average more than 1,000 North Koreans defect to the South every year, but most travel via China and numbers have fallen since Kim Jong Un came to power in 2011. It is unusual for a North Korean to cross the land border dividing the two Koreas. They have been in a technical state of war since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. The last time a North Korean soldier had defected across the JSA was in 2007.",1,fakenewsnet,,Escape from North Korea: video shows defector under fire

"The Twilight actress absolutely shredded the Republican nominee.And the reason why is pretty clear. Throughout his campaign, Donald Trump has repeatedly insulted women to the point where if only women voted in this election Hillary Clinton would win in a landslide that would give her a mandate.Indeed, Clinton is on pace to do even better with women on November 8th than President Obama did in 2008 and 2012.But just in case there are women out there who have not heard any of the things Trump has said about them, Nikki Reed blasted Trump s misogyny in a new video posted by Humanity For Hillary.In the video, Reed slammed Donald Trump and all the men who support him in an NSFW feminist smackdown that Trump is going to throw a hissy fit about on Twitter for days. This has been a bruising election, Reed begins. On the one hand, we have the chance to elect a lifelong public servant, powerful, experienced, highly qualified to be the first female President of the United States. On the other hand, a candidate who reminds us of the worst men in our lives. Men who saw a powerful woman and tried to block her rise. Our rise. Men who called us bossy, unlikable, liars, and attention seekers. Ambitious, like that s a bad thing. Reed went on to talk about how misogynists like Trump attacked women for doing things like writing books and making movies and that when women continued to achieve new heights despite them they started hurling insults like the C-word, a word that Donald Trump has used in the past. I ve been called the C-word, Reed said. Have you been called the C-word? Reed then pointed out that there is an anti-Hillary SuperPac called C.U.N.T. and proceeded reference Trump calling Hillary a nasty woman by calling upon all nasty women to vote against Trump on Election Day because we are so very close to putting all of that behind us because nasty women vote. And then she sent a message to Trump and his deplorable sexist supporters. So Donald Trump and to every man like Donald Trump who grabbed us, blocked us, who called us fat, unqualified, stupid, ugly and c*nt, we have one thing to say to you: C. U. Next Tuesday. Here s the video via Facebook.Make no mistake, if this campaign and Donald Trump s life before it are any indication, women will be treated like absolute shit if Trump somehow becomes president. There is no doubt about that whatsoever. That s why is it crucial that women vote on Election Day no matter what. Because if Trump wins, women will lose everything they have fought for over the last 100 years, including the right to vote.Featured image via video screen capture",0,fakenewsnet,, Nikki Reed DESTROYS Trump For Insulting Women In Epic Video

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Tuesday that the killing of former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh would, in the short term, likely worsen an already dire humanitarian situation in the country. Saleh was killed in a roadside attack on Monday after switching sides in Yemen s civil war, abandoning his Iran-aligned Houthi allies in favor of a Saudi-led coalition. Coupled with a Saudi-led blockade and internal clashes, the stalemate has contributed to a human catastrophe. Some 7 million people are on the brink of famine, while one million are suspected to be infected with cholera. Mattis, speaking with reporters on a military aircraft en route to Washington after a brief trip to parts of the Middle East and South Asia, said it was too early to say what impact the killing would have on the war. He said it could either push the conflict towards U.N. peace negotiations or make it an even more vicious war. (But)one thing I think I can say with a lot of concern and probably likelihood is that the situation for the innocent people there, the humanitarian side, is most likely to (get) worse in the short term, Mattis said. He did not explain his reasoning. The war has already killed more than 10,000 and displaced millions. So this is where we ve all got to roll up our sleeves. Now, what are you going to do about medicine and food and clean water and cholera, Mattis said. I think there has got to be a lot more focus on the humanitarian side right now. Analysts said Saleh s death would be a huge moral boost for the Houthis and a serious blow to the Saudi-led coalition that intervened in the conflict to try to restore the internationally recognized government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. Saudi Arabia and its allies receive logistical and intelligence help from the United States. Mattis said he did not believe the U.S. military would play a role in easing the humanitarian situation.",1,fakenewsnet,,Yemen humanitarian situation likely to worsen with Saleh death: Mattis

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clinton called on Friday for voters to reject the “bigotry” of Donald Trump’s White House campaign, releasing a television ad criticizing his efforts to appeal to black voters and saying she was reaching out to people from all parties who are troubled by his candidacy. The ad shows video of Trump’s controversial pitch to black voters, in which the Republican candidate urges them to support him by asking, “What do you have to lose?” It also shows headlines about a racial discrimination lawsuit the New York real estate mogul faced in the 1970s. Clinton’s presidential campaign said the ad, released a day after she gave a speech accusing Trump of fueling America’s “radical fringe,” would air in the hotly contested states of Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Polls give Clinton a wide margin over Trump among Hispanic voters, but he is on a pitch to reduce her advantage by stressing he would create jobs for all. Trump pressed on with trying to broaden his appeal to minority voters on Friday, as he met with Hispanic business leaders at his signature hotel in Las Vegas. “We’ve been doing very, very well with the Latinos. We’ve been doing amazing, far, far greater ... than anyone understands. They want to see jobs come in, we’re going to bring jobs. They want to see things happen,” Trump said. He said the country’s GDP growth rate of 1.1 percent in the second quarter was not a good sign for the U.S. economy. “The country has some very, very serious problems,” he said. Clinton, meanwhile, followed up on Thursday’s tough speech by saying that Trump’s temperament and divisiveness made him unfit for the White House. “I am reaching out to everyone, Republicans, Democrats, independents, everyone who is as troubled as I am by the bigotry and divisiveness of Donald Trump’s campaign,” she told MSNBC, adding she was asking “fair-minded Americans to repudiate this kind of divisive demagoguery” at the Nov. 8 election. Clinton attacks came during a difficult week for her campaign, as the release of new emails from her time as secretary of state revived criticism of her decision to use a private address and server rather than a government one. The emails also stoked scrutiny of her family’s charitable foundation, including accusations that major corporate and foreign donors gave money in hopes of securing more access to then-Secretary Clinton. Her campaign says no donors received any special favors. Republican National Committee spokesman Sean Spicer told MSNBC Clinton was only talking about Trump and race this week to deflect attention from that controversy. Trump countered her rhetoric on Friday by releasing a video showing Clinton in the 1990s discussing a crime bill and referring to “super-predators,” or at-risk youth she said needed to be brought under control. The video also shows U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, Clinton’s main opponent in the Democratic primary this year, calling that phrase a “racist term.” In targeting what she terms Trump’s bigotry, Clinton hopes to remind voters of controversial statements he has made over the course of the campaign. Those include describing some Mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists, suggesting a judge could not be fair because of his Mexican-American heritage, and proposing a temporary ban on Muslim immigration to combat terrorism. Trump has tried to sidestep these dust-ups by saying Democrats have failed minorities with their economic policies, leaving them living in poverty and attending failing schools. Jennifer Hochschild, a professor at Harvard University who focuses on race and immigration, said she did not think Trump could fix his relationship with black and Hispanic voters. “General cluelessness about racial dynamics will diminish any possible black support that comes from Trump’s emphasis on job creation,” Hochschild said in an email. “And Clinton has a lot of deep roots among black politicians.” Trump also has been criticized for vowing to deport millions of people living in the United States illegally. In recent days, he had appeared to hold out the possibility of toning down his hardline stance, although his precise plans on immigration have been harder to pin down. On Thursday, he denied he would loosen his proposed immigration restrictions.",1,fakenewsnet,,Clinton attacks Trump's outreach to black voters in new ad

"JALALABAD, Afghanistan (Reuters) - A Pakistani diplomatic official was shot by unknown gunmen near his residence in the city of Jalalabad in eastern Afghanistan on Monday, officials said. Pakistan Foreign ministry spokesman Mohammad Faisal issued a statement saying the Afghan charge d affaires in Islamabad had been summoned to protest the incident which consular officials said occurred in front of a staff guesthouse. He condemned the killing and demanded increased security for Pakistani diplomatic staff from Afghan authorities. Relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan have been going through a stormy period with tensions over the latest U.S. strategic plan for the region and disputes over the Torkham border crossing, which Pakistan has closed periodically. Afghanistan s ambassador to Pakistan, Omar Zakhilwal condemned the killing in a message on Twitter and said he had conveyed his government s sympathies to the ministry of foreign affairs in Islamabad.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump honored military veterans in Washington on Saturday at a Kennedy Center event that resembled both a political rally and an evangelical Christian religious service ahead of the July 4 Independence Day holiday. Using the podium again to lash out at the news media, Trump worked to energize evangelicals in his political base, noting that the U.S. currency was inscribed with the words: “In God We Trust.” “Since the signing of the Declaration of Independence 241 years ago, America always affirmed that liberty comes from our creator. Our rights are given to us by God, and no earthly force can ever take those rights away,” he said. Attendees at the event for veterans waved miniature American flags from their seats in the theater and raised their hands as a sign of praise while a large choir sang ahead of Trump’s remarks. The president praised veterans from each of the U.S. military branches and highlighted his administration’s work to reform veterans’ services. Trump, who is spending a long weekend at his property in Bedminster, New Jersey, flew back to Washington for the rally but did not spend the night at the White House, preferring to return to Bedminster. Later, in a rare late-night post on Twitter, which he uses prolifically and sometimes controversially, Trump wrote: “We will always take care of our GREAT VETERANS. You have shed your blood, poured your love, and bared your soul, in defense of our country.” Trump has held campaign-like rallies regularly during his first few months in the White House and kicked off his own re-election campaign far earlier than other incumbents in recent history. Part of his strategy to connect with his supporters has included criticizing the media, and he included harsh words for the press again in his remarks. “The fake media is trying to silence us, but we will not let them,” he said. “The fake media tried to stop us from going to the White House. But I’m president, and they’re not.”",1,fakenewsnet,,"Trump praises veterans, hits media at Kennedy Center event"
"This may shock you, this may not, but Trump has been delegating the duty of writing his executive orders to some scary people well, a scary person, that is.If you thought executive orders limiting Muslim entry into the United States, stripping health international organizations of federal funds if they so much as mention abortion, authorizing the building of literal f*cking concentration camps to hold the illegals The Donald intends to round up, and beginning the process of stripping health care from millions of impoverished Americans sounded like Breitbart s Christmas list come to life, you were exactly right.According to White House aides, Trump has been delegating the duty of writing the rapid stream of absolutely f*cking terrifying executive orders to the same guy who ran Breitbart. Trump s Chief Strategist and former executive chair called his publication a platform for the alt-right (for those who are unaware, alt-right means Nazi ) and the views that would be associated with one who cultivates that sort of cesspool are definitely making themselves apparent in the nature of Trump s orders.Things are a mess in the White House at the moment. According to Politico, no one seems to have any idea what the hell they are doing or, more importantly, what Trump is doing with his flawed orders that might be unworkable, unenforceable or even illegal :Just a small circle of officials at the Department of Health and Human Services knew about the executive action starting to unwind Obamacare, and only less than two hours before it was released. Key members of Congress weren t consulted either, according to several members. And at a conference in Philadelphia, GOP legislators say they had no idea whether some of the executive orders would contrast with existing laws because they hadn t reviewed them.The breakneck pace of Trump s executive actions might please his supporters, but critics are questioning whether the documents are being rushed through without the necessary review from agency experts and lawmakers who will bear the burden of actually carrying them out. For example, there are legal questions on how the country can force companies building pipelines to use materials manufactured domestically, which might not be available or which could violate trade treaty obligations. There s also the question of whether the federal government can take billions from cities who don t comply with immigration enforcement actions: Legal experts said it was unclear.Aides say that it is often difficult to know what order Trump intends to sign at any given moment or even what is in some of them because of the secretive nature in which they are being drafted by Bannon and the small circle of friends Trump has handling them.To make matters worse, Bannon is in the process of a huge power grab right now, giving two of his former staffers at the white supremacist hate rag seats at the table. The Hill reports:One of Breitbart s biggest stars, Julia Hahn, is expected to join the White House as an aide to Bannon. Breitbart s national security editor, Sebastian Gorka, will also relocate to the White House, likely with a spot on the president s National Security Council, Business Insider reported on Tuesday.The Breitbartization of the White House comes as no surprise to people at the conservative news site. I m surprised it took this long, one Breitbart reporter told The Hill. There are a number of people on staff who clearly have resumes that would lend themselves to the administration. These two are ideologically in line with Bannon. They re people he can trust. It makes sense. There is no line of separation between the White House and Breitbart they are one in the same, a former Breitbart spokesman who has since disavowed the right-wing hate factory, told The Hill. They effectively are a state-sponsored/controlled platform designed to advance the administration s propaganda. And the administration, in turn, is bringing Breitbart s propaganda to life.Featured image via Getty Images/Ben Jackson",0,fakenewsnet,, HOLY F*CK: Trump Literally Has A White Nationalist Writing His Executive Orders

"MILWAUKEE (Reuters) - Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein said on Thursday she has raised $3.5 million to force recounts of the Nov. 8 election results in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, three states where Donald Trump scored narrow wins. The campaign said it exceeded its initial goal for raising $2.5 million and has enough money to pay Wisconsin’s $1.1 million filing fee due on Friday. At the same time, the party said it raised its target to $4.5 million, with filing deadlines approaching in Pennsylvania on Monday and Michigan on Wednesday. Stein is pushing for recounts because experts pointed to statistical anomalies in the tallies in all three battleground states, according to the party’s website. Trump, a Republican who ran as an anti-establishment maverick, carried all three states by narrow margins despite public opinion polls pointing to victories by Hillary Clinton, the Democratic standard-bearer. “We deserve elections we can trust,” the campaign said, adding that the effort was not intended to help Clinton. A representative of the president-elect’s transition team could not be reached for comment. But Kellyanne Conway, a senior Trump adviser, suggested that efforts to force recounts were ironic, given harsh criticism of Trump before the election when he would not say whether he would accept the result of what he called a “rigged” political system. “Look who can’t accept the election results,” Conway said in a Twitter message, pointing to a headline in the New York Times that read “Hillary Clinton Supporters Call for Vote Recount in Battleground States.” Although Clinton won more votes than Trump on a nationwide basis, the real estate developer exceeded the number of votes in the Electoral College needed to take the presidency. Electoral votes are apportioned state by state, mostly on a winner-take-all basis. Stein took a little more than 1 percent of the popular vote, while Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson came in third place behind Trump and Clinton. Stein’s website said that the total cost of recounts in the three states was $6 million to $7 million, but it did not explain why the campaign’s new target was only $4.5 million.",1,fakenewsnet,,Green Party raises $3.5 million for presidential vote recounts

"In an effort to prepare his supporters for the upcoming Republican primary, Ted Cruz urged them to put on their armor of God and not believe any bad things people say about him. I want to tell everyone to get ready, strap on the full armor of God, get ready for the attacks that are coming, Cruz said according to the Washington Post.Cruz leads in some Iowa polls over Donald Trump and has seen a rise in national polls despite the fact that his religious zealotry is a huge threat to our democracy and Constitution.And that s why he is telling his fanatics to cover their ears and refuse to believe or even consider any attacks made against him, even if they might be true. Unfortunately, there are a lot of folks in politics who are not constrained by what they view as quaint notions of the truth, Cruz continued. They believe particularly as you get close to an election day, that they can just toss out any lie, any attack and the attack will do its damage before anyone discovers that it s not true. So I want everyone here to get ready, because that is coming, and it s coming with a ferocity none of us has ever seen. Cruz claims that establishment Republicans are trying to sabotage his campaign by telling lies about him. In reality, the only lies being told are the ones coming from Cruz s own mouth.Like when he was caught in a lie last month on live television during an appearance on Fox News while claiming that he didn t want an immigration bill to pass in the Senate, which didn t match up with previous statements he has made.Or how about when Cruz was outed as a complete hypocrite on CNN when Dana Bash pointed out that he wouldn t be running for president today had the United States not granted asylum to his father. In fact, he may not have ever existed since Cruz s father would have likely been killed in Cuba if the United States government had succumbed to fears over Communism being spread by immigrants.And then there s the time Cruz claimed that Christians do not commit acts of terrorism, conveniently ignoring the KKK, anti-abortion lunatics, Timothy McVeigh and multiple mass shootings that have occurred in recent years.Ted Cruz is basically treating his supporters like a cult leaders treat their followers. He is telling them to ignore what is said outside the campaign and is using religious rhetoric to gin them up into a frenzy. He wants them to believe that he is a divine leader sent by God to rule the country like a king, which is literally what an Iowa Republican actually does believe.Facts and truth do not matter to Ted Cruz. He only wants people to believe what he tells them to believe. And if he does win, theocracy will replace our democracy as the Bible replaces our Constitution.Featured Image: YouTube/ Wikimedia",0,fakenewsnet,, Ted Cruz Tells His Fanatics To Put On Their ‘Armor Of God’ To Prepare To Fight For Him

"Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell might just find himself the next target of one of Donald Trump s temper tantrums on Twitter.Earlier today during a Politico Playbook event, McConnell basically threw Trump under the bus and humiliated him in front of everyone when he very bluntly said that Mexico would NOT be paying for Trump s idiotic, ineffective border wall a statement that greatly contradicts everything that Trump promised during his presidential campaign.When McConnell was questioned about Trump s wall, McConnell first tried to give a diplomatic answer and said, there are some places along the border where that s probably not the best way to secure the border. However, when he was further pressed to see if he felt Mexico would pay for the wall, McConnell dropped all niceties and put his thoughts very bluntly. He smirked and said: Uh, no. McConnell and everyone in the room then shared a laugh, all at Trump s expense.You can watch McConnell poke fun at Trump below: For a leading Republican like McConnell to embarrass the Republican Party s leader and sitting POTUS like this is certainly surprising, and it only proves just how few people actually believe Trump is competent enough for this role and will be able to deliver his promises to the American people.Already, we ve seen Trump walk back several of his major campaign promises, one of them being this Mexico border wall. Mexico s leaders have already repeatedly stated that Mexico will not pay for the wall, and Trump has had to cover it up and lie to the American people and say that first taxpayers will pay for the wall, only to be reimbursed by Mexico at a later date which Mexico has not agreed to.

It may well go down in history as the worst logo ever created.People were quick to point out that TP stands for toilet paper, which is remarkably appropriate when you consider all the crap that spills from Trump s mouth every time he opens it.

Trump s website no longer features the logo or even a picture of his new running mate, instead going with just a picture of the bigoted billionaire himself and his trademark slogan Make America great again.

This pitiful blunder will live on, if only for our amusement. In the future, Trump s campaign would be well advised to use a different design company when it comes to creating their logos. Honestly, you have to wonder if the logo s creator was really so clueless that the obvious shortcomings of the design just happened to slip under their radar, or if the image was just a very public trolling.

"BERLIN (Reuters) - German lawmakers have protested after Wolfgang Schaeuble, the new president of the Bundestag, announced a ban on sending tweets from inside the parliament chamber. In a letter published in German media on Thursday, the former finance minister told lawmakers that using devices to photograph, tweet or send messages from the plenary chamber is inappropriate to the proceedings of the Bundestag . German politicians are far behind other countries in addressing voters via Twitter s short messaging service, and none comes close to U.S. President Donald Trump - but the measure has not gone unprotested. This is not going to be the last word on the matter, tweeted conservative lawmaker Dorothee B r, who with more than 64,000 followers is among the biggest Twitter stars of German politics, proving her adeptness with a winking smiley and a string of hashtags. You can watch parliamentary sessions live, but we can t tweet from it, tweeted her liberal colleague Frank Sitta. Would a handwritten letter from inside be ok? It makes no sense! It was not clear if either of those tweets had been sent from the parliament chamber. The backlash comes after an election which heard promises to address Germany s relative slowness in adopting the latest digital technologies. Politicians fear the industrial and export titan s strength risks being undermined by more nimble digital upstarts from Silicon Valley. During his decade at the finance ministry, Schaeuble earned a reputation for ruthlessly policing indebted euro zone states budgets.

"MADRID (Reuters) - Broadly positive results from BBVA and Sabadell were overshadowed on Friday by growing fears over the impact of Catalonia s bid for independence. The crisis has split Catalonia and caused deep resentment around Spain. It has also prompted a flight of business from the wealthy region and alarmed European leaders who fear the crisis could fan separatist sentiment around the continent. BBVA and Sabadell are among the Spanish banks with the highest exposure to the region, where Madrid was preparing to impose direct rule on Friday Shares in Sabadell were the among the worst performers on Spain s Ibex-35 falling 4.5 percent, while BBVA dropped 1.8 percent as investors focused on events in Catalonia. We did see some movements of deposits during a few days but really nothing material and things have really normalized but there were some days when clients were nervous about the uncertainty, BBVA s chief executive officer, Carlos Torres, told analysts Deposits in the northeastern region were safe, although if the situation persists it could cut Spanish growth to less than 2.5 percent in 2018, he later added. Although BBVA is based in the northern city of Bilbao it became one of the biggest lenders in Catalonia after buying two former savings banks in the region, Catalunya Banc and Unnim. In an attempt to calm clients, Sabadell decided in early October to move its legal headquarters out of Catalonia. While an economic recovery and a property rebound has allowed most of Spain s banks to tackle toxic balance sheets faster than peers in Italy, the results from BBVA and Sabadell underlined that pressure on revenue from lending remains. Spanish banks are struggling to lift earnings from loans, as interest rates hover at historic lows and increasing competition erodes margins. BBVA s net interest income (NII), or profit from loans minus funding cost, was down around 2 percent against the previous quarter, while Sabadell s NII fell 4 percent. To offset pressure at home, Spanish banks have been expanding abroad in search of higher revenues. BBVA s net profit was up 19 percent up for the period July to September to 1.14 billion euros, slightly above analysts forecast in a Reuters poll, boosted by Mexico, which accounts for more than 40 percent of its earnings. Net profit at Sabadell however fell 8 percent in the third quarter to 203 million euros, below analysts forecasts, after its bottom line was impacted by the sale of some its units. The lender however stuck to its profit target of 800 million euros for 2017. Friday s results showed BBVA, the country s second biggest bank by assets, reduced its non-performing loans by 1.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion) in the quarter, while Sabadell reduced its problematic assets by 500 million euros. Sabadell s chief executive, Jaime Guardiola, said it would also meet its target of reducing problematic assets by 2 billion euros by year-end despite the political uncertainty. The European Central Bank announced this month new guidelines for lenders to reduce bad loans, although the plans are meeting with a fierce backlash in Italy. Italian banks have more than 210 billion in non-performing exposure, while Spanish banks have combined non-performing loans of 106 billion euros..",1,fakenewsnet,,"Catalonia casts shadow on positive BBVA, Sabadell results"

"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - The United Nations plans to move up to 10,000 illegal migrants from Libya next year, a senior U.N. official said on Tuesday, in a bid to relieve the plight of thousands stranded in deteriorating conditions in detention centers there. Libya is the main departure point for migrants fleeing poverty or war to reach Europe by boat as smugglers exploit turmoil gripping the country since the 2011 overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi. Illegal migrant arrivals in Italy have fallen by two-thirds since July from the same period last year since the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli, Italy s partner, cut back human smuggling at one major hub. Italy also helps in the Libyan coast guard s operations. But activists say the push has led to worsening of conditions in detention centers, where Human Rights Watch and other groups say migrants face overcrowding, abuse, lack of medical facilities and a shortage of food. The U.N. is repatriating migrants to African countries willing to take them back but it was also in talks with European countries and Canada to take in some refugees, Roberto Mignone, chief mission of the U.N. refugee agency, said. This week we are going to send out of Libya 350 refugees, until the end of January we will send out at least 1000, he told Reuters in an interview. In 2018 we are planning to send out of Libya between 5,000 to 10,000 refugees. We give priority to women, children, elderly, disabled, persons who suffered very seriously.

"Trump s team is taking historical revisionism to a whole new level.During an appearance on CNN with Victor Blackwell, Donald Trump s mouthpiece Katrina Pierson claimed that President Obama is responsible for creating ISIS because he invaded Afghanistan. If you want to go way back, we can look at the troop surge, Pierson said. And after 2007, al Qaeda was essentially in ashes. It was Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton who then destroyed the entire rollout by wanting to pull out early, announcing their plans, ignoring intelligence and that s the reason why ISIS is a global issue and not a A confused Blackwell interrupted. Barack Obama in 2004, is that what you said? he asked.And Pierson s rant just got even more confusing. No, Pierson responded. I said afterwards. After the surge when al Qaeda was in ashes. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton remember we weren t even in Afghanistan by this time. Barack Obama went into Afghanistan creating another problem. It was Hillary Clinton and her incidents in Libya. They armed the rebels and funded them. Blackwell gave Pierson another chance to get her facts straight but she only continued trying to rewrite American history.BLACKWELL: You re saying Barack Obama took the country into Afghanistan post-2009. Is that what you re saying? PIERSON: Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton that was Obama s war, yes. Here s the video via YouTube:Of course, Pierson is absolutely wrong.The United States invaded Afghanistan in 2001 during George W. Bush s first year as president. President Obama took office in 2009 and inherited the War in Afghanistan.So if we go by Pierson s logic, that means George W. Bush and Republicans are responsible for the rise of ISIS because they were the ones who took America into Afghanistan.This isn t the first time Pierson has blamed President Obama for a war started by Bush.Earlier this month, Pierson falsely claimed that President Obama is responsible for the death of Captain Humayun Khan, who sacrificed his life in Iraq to save his fellow American soldiers in 2004. It was under Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton that changed the rules of engagement that probably cost (Khan s) life, she said.But again, George W. Bush was president when the United States invaded Iraq in 2003. Obama was a senator at the time and he voted AGAINST the invasion. The Iraq War created a power vacuum that strengthened Iran s power in the region and allowed ISIS to rise.And Blackwell thoroughly fact-checked Pierson after the commercial break by giving her a history lesson. The origin of ISIS began in Iraq in 2004 and morphed into the organization we know today in 2006.Here s the video via Here is the follow up where Victor Blackwell fact checks Katrina Pierson and her ISIS history.. pic.twitter.com/4FhelNe7ah Richard W. August 13, 2016And it should be noted that President Bush signed the status of forces agreement that led to the withdrawal of all American troops from Iraq, thus giving ISIS the opportunity to take over large swaths of the country.Nevertheless, the tradition of Republicans blaming President Obama for everything that happened under George W. Bush s watch continues.Featured Image: Screenshot",0,fakenewsnet,, WATCH: Trump Campaign Spokeswoman Says President Obama Started The War In Afghanistan

"According to insider, and author Edward Klein, Hillary took on Barack Obama over his involvement in exposing her email scandal several months ago. Many Americans are wondering if Obama is stonewalling the FBI s investigation, or if in fact, he is encouraging the investigation, hoping it will take her down. This isn t the first report of Hillary behaving in a manner that is, shall we say, un-presidential? According to White House insiders, it seems that Bill has been on the receiving end of Hillary s rage more than once as well An enraged Hillary Rodham Clinton blew up at President Obama, demanding he call off your f king dogs looking into her emails during a tense Oval Office meeting, according to a new book.The book, Unlikeable: The Problem with Hillary, says the former first lady was furious at what she believed were damaging leaks by Obama aides that led to investigations of her use of a private email server as secretary of state. So she went right to the top to settle the matter.Clinton requested a meeting with Obama, against the advice of hubby Bill Clinton, believing she was being persecuted for minor, meaningless violations, author Edward Klein writes.Clinton initially took a friendly approach during the meeting and Obama reacted as if he didn t know what she was talking about, the book claims. He was almost being deliberately dense, a Clinton source said. It really angered her. Clinton lost her temper and called the president by his first name in an emotionally driven break with White House decorum, according to the book. What I want for you to do is call off your f king dogs, Barack! Clinton allegedly barked at Obama, according to Klein s account, which cited sources close to Clinton and Obama senior adviser Valerie Jarrett.The president was so stunned by Clinton s disrespectful demands, he needed a moment to compose himself, the book claims.Obama then responded, There is nothing I can do for you one way or another. Things have been set in motion, and I can t and won t interfere. Your problems are, frankly, of your own making. If you had been honest . . . Klein reports Clinton interrupted, There are always haters out there to get the Clintons. The Democratic 2016 front-runner is said to have later regretted her tirade against the president not for the disrespect she showed, but for the weakness she displayed.Nick Merrill, Clinton s spokesman, called Klein s account bulls t.

"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Islamic State suicide attackers killed at least 50 people in a triple car bomb attack on Thursday among a group of refugees in northeast Syria, a medical source in the Kurdish Red Crescent said. A large number of people were also injured by the three car bombs set off by the attackers, the source said. The attack took place at Abu Fas, near the border of Deir al-Zor and Hasaka provinces, said a war monitor, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which said earlier that at least 18 people had been killed. The dead included refugees fleeing the fighting in Deir al-Zor as well as members of the Kurdish Asayish security force, the Observatory reported. Syrian state television said dozens had been killed in the attack. The jihadist group has lost swathes of its territory in both Syria and Iraq this year and is falling back on the towns and villages of the Euphrates valley southeast of Deir al-Zor. The U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias is pressing it from the north and a rival offensive by the Syrian army, supported by allies including Iran and Russia, is attacking it from the west. On Wednesday it said it carried out an attack in the capital Damascus, where three suicide bombers detonated their devices near a police headquarters, killing two people and wounding six.

"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland s ruling Fine Gael party has opened up an eight-point lead over its nearest rival, an opinion poll showed on Sunday, suggesting the minority government was seeing a bounce under new prime minister Leo Varadkar. Varadkar, the 38-year-old son of an Indian immigrant and the first gay premier of the once-staunchly Catholic country, succeeded Enda Kenny in May as members of his center-right Fine Gael hoped a young, straight-talking leader would propel the party ahead of main rival Fianna Fail. Fine Gael secured the support of 33 percent of respondents to the Sunday Times/Behaviour & Attitudes poll, up from 29 percent in July, while the opposition Fianna Fail fell five points to 25 percent. All of this increase has come from those who were undecided about the Taoiseach (prime minister) in the previous poll, said Behaviour & Attitudes executive chairman Ian McShane. In opinion polls taken before the summer recess, Fine Gael had mostly held only a marginal lead over Fianna Fail. Varadkar s minority government relies on the backing of fellow center-right Fianna Fail in key votes, under a deal due to last under October 2018, although many analysts expect an election to be called before the agreement concludes. Fine Gael won 25.5 percent of the vote at last year s election, to Fianna Fail s 24.3 percent, leaving both well short of the support needed to form a coalition government. Support for Ireland s third largest party Sinn Fein rose one point to 19 percent in the poll. Both Fine Gael and Fianna Fail say they will not consider forming a coalition government with left-wing Sinn Fein after the next election.",1,fakenewsnet,,Varadkar bounce gives Ireland's Fine Gael eight-point poll lead

In mid-September, a suspect was recorded on security cameras placing quantities of poison in products for sale in some southern German supermarkets. He told the police via email that he done so, and threatened to do it nationwide and elsewhere in Europe unless given money.

"GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - Guatemala s federal auditor on Tuesday said it will investigate a salary bonus the Defense Ministry gives to President Jimmy Morales that raises his earnings by more than a third, making him one of the best paid leaders in Latin America. The federal comptroller, which audits all government spending, said in a statement it had asked for information on the previously unknown 50,000 quetzals ($7,300) Bonus for Extraordinary Responsibility that is not officially part of the president s salary package. Defense Minister William Mansilla on Tuesday confirmed that Morales had since December 2016 received the payment, which lifts the president s salary to $27,400 a month. The president didn t ask for it. Instead, it was a group decision by the army, Mansilla said in a press conference. A technical board of auditors determined the bonus. The revelation of the unusual salary perk comes at an awkward time for the beleaguered Morales, who managed to retain his immunity from prosecution on Monday. Congress voted overwhelmingly to protect him after the attorney general submitted a request to investigate Morales over suspected financing irregularities during his 2015 election campaign. [nL2N1LS1EV] Last month, Guatemala s attorney general and the U.N.-backed International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) jointly sought to investigate Morales, a former comedian, over the illegal financing allegation. Two days later, Morales declared the head of the U.N. body persona non grata. Under the leadership of Ivan Velasquez, a veteran Colombian prosecutor, CICIG has caused problems for Morales, first investigating his son and brother then aiming at him. The Defense Ministry on Tuesday posted on its website documents, dated Jan. 1, 2016, that detailed the payment to the president and various other military officials. The considerations (for the bonus) were due to his position and the risks and dangers that (Morales) undertakes, Mansilla said in explaining the army s reasoning for the payment. Former Presidents Alfonso Portillo and Alvaro Colom told Reuters they had not received such a bonus. The president s office did not respond to requests for comment. The salary bonus means that Morales earns 70 percent more than Chilean leader Michelle Bachelet and 130 percent more than Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, two of the region s best paid top officials. The bonus is also 90 times the $300 minimum wage in Guatemala, where 60 percent of the population lives in poverty.",1,fakenewsnet,,Guatemala federal auditor to probe president's pay bonus

"If Republicans and Donald Trump really care about our military veterans, they will tell this douchebag to shut the hell up.Ohio GOP Rep. Warren Davidson has outraged the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the House Veterans Affairs Committee by referring to veterans as moochers who are just pretending to be hurt or sick when they show up to get medical care from the VA. Just like workers comp out here s got moochers, I wish that there were no vets that were the same sort of problem on our society, Davidson said during a town hall event on Monday. But part of the problem is there are some vets that are moochers and they re clogging up the system, and we do as taxpayers want to make sure the VA filters out these folks that are pretenders. Just like we wish there were no people out there with stolen valor, but that s a problem in the vet community, too. Davidson, who won a special election to replace John Boehner and is a supporter of Donald Trump, has drawn a shitstorm of criticism ever since.Veterans of Foreign Wars spokesman Joe Davis slammed Davidson for insulting the men and women who have served this country. Honorably discharged veterans with service-connected wounds, illnesses and injuries, or who are indigent due to circumstances beyond their control, are not moochers, he said in a statement.House Veterans Affairs Committee chairman Jeff Miller said he hopes that Davidson merely misspoke and called upon him to clarify his remarks.And Davidson s remarks are particularly outrageous because Davidson is a veteran himself.But when given the chance to back down, Davidson did the opposite. Any effort to suggest I have anything other than a soldier s passion for providing our veterans with the care they deserve is dishonest, he said before his spokesman presented four case of VA fraud to somehow prove his claims that veterans are moochers. The problem is that these cases involve people who pretend to be veterans. In other words, the people in these cases are NOT veterans. But Davidson called veterans moochers anyway.It would have been so simple for Davidson to just clarify his remarks, but he didn t because, like Donald Trump, Republicans are incapable of admitting when they are wrong. So Davidson s insult of veterans stands in the record as a testament to how Republicans really feel about the men and women who fought for our country.Featured image via YouTube",0,fakenewsnet,, Trump-Supporting GOP Rep Calls Veterans ‘Moochers’ During Town Hall Event In Ohio
"LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump hit out at former Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond on Thursday, calling him “an embarrassment” as he defended his ownership of a prestigious Scottish golf course. The attack is the latest in a feud between the pair, stemming from Trump’s objection in 2013 to a Scottish government-approved offshore wind farm project near one of his golf courses. Trump has found himself under scrutiny from British politicians more generally after they voted last week to debate a call to ban him from the UK due to public outcry over his proposal to stop Muslims entering the United States. Calling Salmond a “stupid man”, Trump accused him of destroying landscapes by supporting wind farm projects and said he “disgracefully” released from prison a Libyan convicted of blowing up Pan Am flight 103 over the Scottish town of Lockerbie in 1988. “Alex Salmond is an embarrassment to Scotland,” he said. Trump’s statement was issued as a response to Salmond, who had said on Wednesday on a radio program that it would be better for Scotland if the billionaire developer and former reality TV star were not the owner of the Turnberry golf course in the south west of the country. Salmond, a campaigner for Scotland’s independence from the United Kingdom, also said he would support Britain’s interior minister Theresa May if she did issue Trump with a travel ban, ending his comments by suggesting that Trump wore a toupee. In a previous row, Trump had called Salmond a “has-been and totally irrelevant”. Half-Scottish Trump, who speaks proudly of his Gaelic heritage, defended his ownership of Turnberry, one of the two golf resorts he owns in Scotland, saying he was spending 200 million pounds ($290 million)on a revamp. Should Britain ban him from entering, Trump has threatened to cancel 700 million pounds of planned investments in Scotland. “His response to any suggested ban has not changed,” a spokeswoman for Trump said on Thursday.",1,fakenewsnet,,Trump blasts former Scottish leader as war of words grows

"LA PAZ (Reuters) - More than half the ballots cast in Bolivia s judicial elections on Sunday were spoiled, or nullified, by voters, a sign that the opposition said showed dwindling support for President Evo Morales. Tensions are high in Bolivia after the Constitutional Court last week gave Morales the green light to run for a fourth straight term in 2019. Morales opponents encouraged voters to spoil their ballots in protest of the ruling. Morales, a former coca farmer in power since 2006, had previously accepted the results of a referendum in 2016, when 51 percent of voters rejected his proposal to end term limits. The citizens have defeated Evo Morales, a leader who is trying to impose re-election on Bolivia, along with corruption and the manipulation of the justice system, businessman and former presidential candidate Samuel Doria Medina Tweeted. The 26 judges elected on Sunday will be seated in January. Morales said in a news conference on Monday that the high number of spoiled ballots should not be seen as a protest against him, but as an attempt by the opposition to block his plan for a judiciary with elected rather than appointed judges. The unpatriotic right wing wanted the election of an organic judiciary to fail, but the people have elected their authorities; judges who answer to the people, not to politicians, Morales said. The 96 candidates on the ballot were preselected by Congress, where Morales has a majority. Opposition leaders said the vote was a ploy to give Morales supporters control over the electoral court. Ballots were spoiled by marking more than one candidate, scratching or ripping the papers or doodling on them. A preliminary report by Bolivia s elections authority said 78 percent of the country s 6.4 million eligible voters participated in the election and that more than 50 percent of the ballots cast were spoiled.",1,fakenewsnet,,Bolivians spoil ballots in judicial vote to protest Morales

"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump and some of Silicon Valley’s most powerful executives met at his Manhattan tower on Wednesday, a summit convened to smooth over frictions after both sides made no secret of their disdain for each other during the election campaign. The meeting focused chiefly on economic issues, including job creation, lowering taxes and trade dynamics with China, while largely skirting the many disagreements the tech industry has with Trump on matters ranging from immigration to digital privacy, according to a Trump transition team statement. Trump proposed reconvening with the tech leaders as often as every quarter, the statement said. Three of Trump’s adult children, Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka, sat at the head of a large rectangular table as the meeting began in a conference room on the 25th floor of Trump Tower. Their attendance may fuel further concern about potential conflicts of interests for Trump, who has said he would hand over control of his business empire to his children while he occupies the White House. Vice President-elect Mike Pence was also there. Guests sat in front of paper name plates and bottles of water sporting the Trump brand logo. The meeting between tech luminaries, including Apple Inc’s Tim Cook, Facebook Inc’s Sheryl Sandberg and Tesla Motors Inc’s Elon Musk, took place as Trump has alarmed some U.S. corporations with his rhetoric challenging long-established policy toward China, a main market for Silicon Valley. A senior Chinese state planning official told the China Daily newspaper Wednesday that Beijing could slap a penalty on a U.S. automaker for monopolistic behavior, a warning delivered days after Trump questioned acknowledging Taiwan as part of “one China.” The official did not identify the automaker. “There’s nobody like the people in this room, and anything we can do to help this go along we’re going to do that for you,” Trump told the executives in the presence of reporters. “You call my people, you call me, it doesn’t make any difference. We have no formal chain of command.” Trump added: “We’re going to make fair trade deals. We’re going to make it a lot easier for you to trade across borders.” Other participants included Alphabet Inc’s Larry Page and Eric Schmidt, Amazon.com’s Jeff Bezos, Microsoft Corp’s Satya Nadella, and Ginni Rometty from IBM. Twitter was not invited to the meeting because it was too small, a transition spokesman told Reuters. Cook and Musk joined Trump for separate meetings after the other technology executives leave, according to a spokesman for Trump’s transition team. Bezos said in a statement the meeting was “very productive” and that he “shared the view that the administration should make innovation one of its key pillars, which would create a huge number of jobs across the whole country, in all sectors, not just tech - agriculture, infrastructure, manufacturing -everywhere.” Trump clashed with Silicon Valley on several issues during the election campaign, including immigration, government surveillance and encryption, and his surprise victory last month alarmed many companies that feared he might follow through on his pledges. He has said that many tech companies are overvalued by investors. “You look at some of these tech stocks that are so, so weak as a concept and a company and they’re selling for so much money,” he told Reuters in an interview in May. Those concerns have not been assuaged in recent weeks as Trump has threatened to upset trade relationships with China and appoint officials who favor expanded surveillance programs. “For some of the companies, there was some hesitation about whether to attend” because of sharp political and personal differences with Trump, one tech industry source said. More than 700 employees of technology companies pledged in an open letter on Tuesday to refuse to help Trump’s administration build a data registry to track people based on their religion or assist in mass deportations. Silicon Valley enjoyed a warm rapport with President Barack Obama and heavily supported Democrat Hillary Clinton during the presidential campaign. Alphabet’s Schmidt was photographed on election night at Clinton headquarters wearing a staff badge, and Musk said in interviews before the election that Trump’s character reflected poorly on the United States. Despite those tensions, Trump named Musk to a business advisory council that will give private-sector input to Trump after he takes office on Jan. 20. The CEOs of Airbnb and Uber were invited but did not attend Wednesday’s gathering. Uber’s Travis Kalanick, traveling in India all week according to a person familiar with his plans, was also appointed to the council. From the employees of the 10 largest Fortune 500 tech companies, Trump raised just $179,400 from 982 campaign donors who contributed more than $200. Clinton raised $4.4 million from the employees of the same companies, with more than 20,400 donations, a Reuters review of contribution data found. Trump publicly bashed the industry during the campaign. He urged his supporters to boycott Apple products over the company’s refusal to help the FBI unlock an iPhone associated with last year’s San Bernardino, California, shootings, threatened antitrust action against Amazon and demanded that tech companies build their products in the United States. Trump has also been an opponent of the Obama administration’s “net neutrality” rules barring internet service providers from obstructing or slowing consumer access to web content. Two advisers to his Federal Communications Commission transition team are opponents of the rules, as are the two Republicans on the FCC. Last week, the two Republicans on the panel urged a quick reversal of many Obama policies and one, Commissioner Ajit Pai, said he believed that net neutrality’s “days are numbered.”",1,fakenewsnet,,Trump meets Silicon Valley elite after mutual mistrust in campaign

"While Donald Trump has been taking vacations, special counsel Robert Mueller has been working hard on the Russia investigation. Instead of golfing this weekend, we suggest that the former reality show star huddle with his lawyers. Trump s former national security adviser Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about conversations with the Russian ambassador and he s fully cooperating with Mueller. As part of the plea deal, Flynn admitted that he was directed by a senior member of the Trump transition team to make contact with Russian officials in December. In addition, Flynn is prepared to testify that Trump as a candidate, ordered him to make contacts with the Russians.This marks the first instance of solid proof that there was collusion between team Trump and a hostile foreign government.On Friday, just after the news broke, the White House insisted that Flynn s guilty plea will not implicate Trump or anyone else in the White House.The White House said in a statement that Flynn was fired for making false statements to Trump officials, and that he worked for the administration for a short time and that he was a former Obama administration official. The false statements involved mirror the false statements to White House officials which resulted in his resignation in February of this year, said White House lawyer Ty Cobb. Nothing about the guilty plea or the charge implicates anyone other than Mr. Flynn. The White House then referred to Flynn as the former National Security Advisor at the White House for 25 days as well as a former Obama administration official. However, the White House left out a few important details. President Obama fired Flynn as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency and he also warned Trump about Flynn during a discussion two days after the election and emphasized that he had concerns about him joining the national security team for the new president.On top of that, just after Flynn was forced to resign, Trump called him a wonderful man who was treated unfairly by the media.Photo by David Becker/Getty Images.",0,fakenewsnet,, White House Panics Knowing Flynn Is Going To Take Them Down

"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Russia has invited the Kurdish-led authorities in northern Syria to its proposed congress of Syria s rival parties in November, a senior Kurdish official said on Tuesday, as Moscow seeks to launch a new initiative to end the Syrian conflict. We are studying the issue and our stance has been positive so far, Badran Jia Kurd, an adviser to the administration that governs Kurdish-led autonomous regions of Syria, told Reuters. It would mark the first time Syria s main Kurdish groups have been brought into peace talks. Although they now control at least a quarter of Syria, Kurdish authorities have so far been left out of international talks in line with Turkish wishes. After intervening decisively in favor of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Russia has sought to spearhead diplomatic efforts among the various combatants over the past year. Moscow has said the congress will focus on compromise solutions towards ending the conflict, which began more than six years ago with street protests against the Syrian leader. A spokesman for the Syrian opposition, which wants peace talks to take place under U.N. supervision, described the proposed congress as really worrying . It was unclear what the aims were and who would join, said Yahya al-Aridi. Aridi also said he feared the congress would be used as fabricated evidence of reconciliation to mislead both the Syrians and foreign countries. Several rounds of U.N. talks in Geneva between the Damascus government and the anti-Assad opposition have gone nowhere. Russia invited 33 Syrian groups and political parties on Tuesday to a Syrian Congress on National Dialogue which it will host on Nov. 18 in the Black Sea resort of Sochi. They include Kurdish groups and anti-Assad rebel factions. The Kurdish-led administration received the invitation at meetings with Russian officials in northern Syria last month and favor the idea as it strives for a political solution, Jia Kurd said. Kurdish officials say they have been in talks with Russia to assess the prospects for dialogue with the Syrian government. Since 2011, the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia and its allies have carved out autonomous cantons in the north. Their territorial grip has expanded since they joined forces with the United States to fight Islamic State militants. But Turkey views Syrian Kurdish power as a national security threat along its border. Ankara considers the YPG as an extension of the outlawed Kurdish PKK movement that has waged a three-decade insurgency inside Turkey. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who sent warplanes to help Assad s military against mostly Sunni rebels in 2015, first mentioned the congress earlier this month. Putin has said it would include all ethnic and religious groups, and the government, and the opposition . Syria s U.N. ambassador, Bashar al-Jaafari, said Damascus was ready to take part in the congress and that the time was now more appropriate to join such talks after its military victories. Since Russia s intervention in 2015, the government has taken back significant territory from rebels opposed to Assad and has this year recaptured swathes of central and eastern Syria from Islamic State. Alexander Lavrentyev, a senior Russian negotiator on Syria, urged Syrian rebel groups to join the congress, provided they support Syria s integrity and sovereignty and status as a secular, democratic state. If someone is against these principles,.. they will of course not go there, he told reporters after a round of talks with Turkish and Iranian delegations in Kazakhstan. But then we think they will risk being sidelined in the political process. The Kazakhstan talks did not produce an anticipated document on prisoner swaps. Lavrentyev said the sides had spent a lot of time discussing the situation in Idlib where Damascus accuses Ankara of acting in coordination with Islamist militants.",1,fakenewsnet,,Russia invites Syrian Kurds to people's congress: Kurdish official

"HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba said on Wednesday it hoped to sign off on at least half a dozen agreements with the United States before businessman Donald Trump, who has threatened to derail detente between the former Cold War foes, becomes president on Jan. 20. Cuban and U.S. officials held talks in Havana to discuss what more could be accomplished during President Barack Obama’s remaining weeks in office, agreeing to arrange more high-level visits and technical meetings. The more Cuba and the United States deepen their detente, the more irreversible it will become, analysts said. “At the moment we are negotiating 12 more (accords) with the aim to be able to conclude and sign a majority of them,” Josefina Vidal, the Cuban foreign ministry’s director of U.S. affairs, told a news conference. The accords would be in areas such as seismology and meteorology, she said, adding that Cuba and the United States had already signed a dozen accords in the two years since they agreed to normalize relations, ending decades of hostility. They have also opened embassies, restored commercial flights and opened travel options. But some fear all that is now at stake, given Republican Trump has said he would seek to reverse the opening unless Communist-ruled Cuba gives the United States what he calls a “better deal”. Vidal declined to comment on Trump’s statements but said she hoped his administration would recognize that the detente had the backing of most Cubans and Americans. “Cuba would hope the new U.S. government takes into account the results we have achieved... that are backed by the majority of the Cuban population (and) U.S. citizens,” she said. Cuba was willing to continue improving relations but “within the respect of the existing differences and without having to make any kind of concession to the principles in which Cuba firmly believes,” Vidal added. In Washington on Wednesday, U.S. lawmakers joined more than 100 Cuban entrepreneurs to urge Trump to continue the thaw. Meanwhile, the Obama administration is pressing American companies to complete business deals in Cuba by then. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd and Norwegian Cruise Line said on Wednesday they had received approval from Cuba’s government to operate cruises to the island. The number of U.S. visitors to Cuba had jumped 68 percent in the first ten months of this year to 208,000, Vidal said.",1,fakenewsnet,,Cuba wants to sign accords with U.S. before Obama exit: officials

"Chicago Tribune Just weeks after stoking controversy by using Nazi imagery on his Jewish deli s Facebook page, the co-owner of Max s Deli in Highland Park again has ignited outrage this time with a tweet he fired off in response to the Las Vegas shootings. Soon as I heard it was country music, I felt relief. White people shooting white people isn t terror it s community outreach. #LasVegas, the tweet read.Morelli attempted to apologize for his remark:Morelli, who described himself as politically lost with no allegiances, said his tweet about the deaths was thoughtless. It was a dumb joke and it didn t work. I own it. It was stupid, Morelli said. It was seven in the morning and I was stressed out and freaked out by the shooting, he added. I was trying to participate, and all I did was put my foot in my mouth. But is he really sorry, or is he only doing damage control? Only one month ago, Morelli posted this vile image on Max s Deli s Facebook page. Although Morelli admitted that after his post, his family, who were affected by his outrageous post, are done with him. Chicago Tribune Highland Park deli is facing backlash over a Facebook post that includes a cartoon drawing of a man wearing a Nazi armband, giving a stiff-armed salute and donning a T-shirt reading, I m with Alt-Right. Greg Morelli, who owns Max s Deli with his brother, posted the image last week. Morelli frequently posts the deli s menu along with cartoon drawings he creates to the restaurant s Facebook page. He said the recent events in Charlottesville inspired him to use the page to make a strong political statement. I have a Jewish deli, I am a Jewish man, Morelli said. I am the first person that s going to get a brick through the window if this plague is not stopped immediately. Morelli, 49, said the image was of an alt-right member who has hair evocative of President Donald Trump, but was not meant to be a depiction of the president himself.The full post and its related image are still on the deli s Facebook page.He said the deli was inundated with calls on Thursday as the post began to spread on Facebook and through news stories. Callers have been criticizing the post s imagery and its political message, he said.The effect of the post on his family has been difficult and Morelli says they are done with him. When you create a storm, everyone that loves you just wants you to take the easy path, he said.In a Facebook post on the restaurant s page Thursday evening, Morelli did not back down from the discussion the initial image provoked. I do not regret getting involved. I do not regret speaking out, he wrote. I do not regret assigning symbolism to hatred. I do not regret being trashed on Facebook. That said, it hurt. When asked about the specific use of Nazi imagery in the post and the reaction to not just his intended message, but the image itself, Morelli said the symbolism was a necessary point to make. We have to use the imagery and assign it to the groups so we know how to react, Morelli said.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trump’s vow to round up and deport all of America’s undocumented immigrants if he is elected president could shrink the economy by around 2 percent, according to a study to be released on Thursday by conservative think tank the American Action Forum. The research adds to concerns about the Republican presidential nominee’s policy proposals, which range from tearing up international trade agreements to building a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. About 6.8 million of the more than 11 million immigrants living in the United States illegally are employed, according to government statistics. Removing them would cause a slump of $381.5 billion to $623.2 billion in private sector output, the Washington-based non-profit said in its analysis. The study added that removing those workers could leave potentially millions of jobs unfilled due to a lack of legal workers willing to do them. Industries with the highest share of undocumented workers include farming, construction and hospitality, according to the research. “The things Donald Trump has said are utterly unworkable,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, the forum’s president, and the top economic adviser to Senator John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign. Asked about the study on Thursday, Trump said he thought the analysts misunderstood his immigration policy, adding he wanted people to come into the country if they came “through the system.” “I saw that report and they don’t even have it right,” Trump said in an interview on CNBC. “We certainly don’t want to shrink our economy.” Trump, who effectively locked up the Republican nomination this week, has called for the deportation of anyone living in the United States illegally, arguing foreign workers hold down salaries and contribute to unemployment. That position has drawn strong opposition from business leaders like the conservative billionaire Koch brothers as well as from human rights advocates. Trump has further angered opponents by saying Mexico was sending rapists and drug dealers to the United States, and by calling for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country to shore up national security. But his hard-line stance on immigration also has triggered strong support among many U.S. voters. Some 52.6 percent of respondents to a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted in September said they want to see most or all undocumented immigrants deported, compared with 34.6 percent who want to see most or all of them stay. The American Action Forum analysis used data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to estimate the value of the output from undocumented immigrants. The study did not factor in potential impacts of mass deportations on consumption, investment and other economic factors, the group said. The U.S. economy is projected to produce some $18.7 trillion worth of goods and services in 2016, according to the International Monetary Fund. A loss of $400 billion in output would amount to about 2 percent of that figure.",1,fakenewsnet,,Trump's deportation plan could slice 2 percent off U.S. GDP: study

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A tiny basement in a house in suburban Washington, D.C. reverberates with music from the Spanish region of Catalonia. A heavy metal rendition of the Catalonian national anthem Els Segadors, or The Reapers has turned a virtually unknown Virginia-based band, A Sound of Thunder, into celebrities in the politically sensitive region in northeastern Spain. Within days of its release, the song racked up more than a million hits on YouTube, making it the band s most popular single since they started in 2008. Thousands of Catalonians voted for independence from Spain during a banned referendum in October that ended in violence and spurred a constitutional crisis in the euro zone s fourth-biggest economy. Back in Manassas, Virginia, Nina Osegueda, the band s lead singer, made a quick decision to release a video of the band s version of Els Segadors on Youtube. Osegueda, whose mother is Catalan, has strong ties to the region and originally recorded the anthem as a tribute to her mother. The song was never intended to be released as a single, but instead was part of the band s new full-length album, It Was Metal, to be released in March 2018. The violence that surrounded the referendum vote changed all that. We have a couple other singles that we were planning on releasing in advance to show people what the new album is going to sound like, she said. But then the vote happened and 800 people were injured by the police trying to vote. So I said we should try and just put the song out to show our support against police brutality. Suddenly it was spreading all over the place... And then I noticed that someone shared us on Twitter and it wound up actually being a Catalan politician, Osegueda said. Music stations in Catalonia picked up the song and Osegueda was interviewed on several radio shows. The attention she has received has spread to her relatives as her Catalonian uncle was interviewed on local radio. On the band s YouTube page, fans have left messages saying they prefer the metal version to the original and many have said the song has struck an emotional chord. Osegueda recorded some parts of the song in Catalan. She doesn t speak the language and singing with proper pronunciation was intimidating, but she says the enthusiasm and support from her new found fans has been humbling. I think the biggest emotional response we ve gotten has been, it brought me to tears which is not normal for a heavy metal song . So for us that was like a big deal, Osegueda said. You know, we re not on a label. We do everything ourselves. So when we see this many people responding it s like it s overwhelming. The band, whose albums have been crowdfunded through various Kickstarter campaigns, will tour Catalonia for the first time in December, just days before regional elections on Dec. 21. They have shows planned in Barcelona, Tarragona and other Catalonian cities. For Osegueda, who has traveled to Catalonia a number of times, the upcoming visit feels different. I ve always enjoyed going there on vacation. But now it s a lot deeper because there s so many people out there who saw our song as inspiration. So I feel like I definitely have a deeper connection now, she said.",1,fakenewsnet,,Virginia heavy metal band strikes chord with Catalonia anthem

Obama is meeting with Attorney General Loretta Lynch on Monday to discuss a three-month review of what actions he could take to help reduce gun violence.The actions, which are staunchly opposed by Republicans and likely to spark a legal fight, underscore Obama s desire to keep up an aggressive agenda in 2016, even as the public s attention shifts to the presidential election.Obama spent much of his vacation out of the public eye, playing golf with friends and dining out on the island of Oahu with his family. He also worked on his final State of the Union address, scheduled for Jan. 12.The address to Congress is a high-profile opportunity for the president to try to reassure the public about his national security stewardship after the terrorism attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, California. Advisers say Obama will also look for other opportunities to keep security issues at the forefront as he tries to ease Americans concerns.Despite his deep differences with Republicans, Obama has cited two agenda items for 2016 that have bipartisan support: a free trade agreement with 11 other nations called the Trans-Pacific Partnership and changes in the criminal justice system that would reduce incarceration rates for nonviolent offenders. He often points out that the U.S. accounts for 5 percent of the world s population and 25 percent of its inmates.Read more: AP",0,fakenewsnet,,Uh Oh!

"PARIS (Reuters) - France has stopped a large shipment of Belarus mushrooms contaminated with low-level radioactivity probably from Chernobyl and not linked to a radioactive cloud that appeared in southern Russia last month, officials said on Thursday. Earlier, the head of French nuclear regulator ASN Pierre-Franck Chevet told the French senate that traces of cesium had been found on imported mushrooms from Russia and did not mention Belarus. A spokesman for French nuclear safety institute IRSN said that a few days ago customs officials found that a 3.5 tonne shipment of Belarus mushrooms coming through Frankfurt, Germany was contaminated with cesium 137, a radioactive nuclide that is a waste product of nuclear reactors. While the contaminated mushrooms did not represent a health threat to consumers, the shipment will be destroyed in a specialized incinerator in coming days, the IRSN said. There is no link with the ruthenium 106 pollution, the official said. Earlier this month the IRSN said that a cloud containing radioactive ruthenium 106 originating from southern Russia had blown over large parts of Europe in October but added that there was no danger to people. Russia later confirmed it had measured ruthenium pollution at nearly 1,000 times normal levels in the Ural mountains, but did not acknowledge any accident. As the mushrooms came from Belarus, it is very likely the contamination originated in Chernobyl, the official said. ASN did not reply to a number of Reuters calls later on Thursday. Chernobyl, Ukraine is just south of the Belarus border and was the site of a major nuclear disaster in 1986. Cesium 137, which has a 30-year half-life, is still widely found in the areas around Chernobyl. The official said it was highly unusual for such a large shipment of mushrooms to be stopped and that none of the produce had made it onto French retail markets. Mushrooms, more than any other vegetable, concentrate radioactivity because their thread-like root systems spread over a large area for several meters on the surface around the plant. The IRSN said eating tens of kilos of the Belarus mushrooms would expose a consumer to a radioactivity level similar to natural ambient radioactivity during a whole year. He added there had been no risk for the customs officials, even if they had touched the mushrooms with their bare hands. Earlier, the head of the French nuclear regulator ASN told the French senate that traces of cesium had been found on imported mushrooms and said there was no connection with the ruthenium pollution. French consumer protection agency DGCCRF said in a statement that the Belarus mushrooms had cesium 137 levels above legal limits but contained no ruthenium 106. The agency said that following the discovery of the ruthenium, it had started testing samples of food products imported from the regions affected by the radioactive cloud. So far, it has not found food items with ruthenium 106 levels above legal thresholds.",1,fakenewsnet,,France stops large shipment of radioactive Belarus mushrooms

The militant group also holds parts of the Syrian side of the border, but the area under their control is shrinking as they retreat in the face of two sets of hostile forces - a U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led coalition and Syrian government troops with foreign Shi ite militias backed by Iran and Russia.

The militants Syrian stronghold, Raqqa, fell to U.S.-backed forces last week. Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who declared the caliphate from Mosul in mid-2014, released an audio recording on Sept. 28 that indicated he was alive, after several reports he had been killed.

So every time someone seems scared of them, it s another boost to their ego.Fortunately, most people are in on the joke at this point, and state and local leaders have become more accustomed to the violence that neo-Nazi rallies bring with them. Even businesses have gotten in on trolling Richard Spencer and his pathetic band of white supremacist losers.Case in point: Alligator Brewing, a craft beer maker located in Tall Paul s Brewhouse in Gainesville had an amazing idea the other day to allow anyone holding two tickets to Spencer s event at UF to come trade them in for a free beer: Ticket become available this Saturday, October 14th and each person can get two with a valid ID. This is our town. This is our home. Let s do this Gainesville.A post shared by Alligator Brewing on Oct 12, 2017 at 3:56pm PDTThat didn t take long to go viral, of course, and Spencer s lackeys soon heard about it. They changed the ticketing process so that people couldn t get them in advance. They became available only in person at the event, according to the Miami Herald. A white supremacist sycophant of Spencer s, Cameron Padgett, told the paper that it was in an effort to avoid the sabotage that was planned by people. Padgett himself then suddenly appeared at Tall Paul s, pretending to try and trade some tickets for beer. After he was told by Alligator Brewing that they couldn t verify the authenticity of his tickets (since the fascists changed their ticketing scheme), he became very belligerent and began filming from inside the bar: Please stay safe #lesshatemorebeerA post shared by Alligator Brewing on Oct 18, 2017 at 3:34pm PDTNone of it was enough to keep the actual event from being a hilarious shitshow for Richard Spencer and his cast of racist clowns.It cost Spencer $10k to rent this hall.The tickets were free.At least 90% of the seats were empty or filled w/protestors.#SpencerAtUF Holly O'Reilly October 19, 2017These Pepe-loving asshats were literally laughed out of the room as protester after protester shut down their racist rhetoric. The event started with a friendly chant by the crowd:THIS is how you punch a Nazi without actually, you know punching a Nazi.""FUCK YOU, SPENCER!"" #SpencerAtUF??????pic.twitter.com/NHXYLfg6j3 Holly O'Reilly October 19, 2017And only got worse from there.

You failed at your own game the world is going to have a very different impression of the University of Florida. The world is not gonna be proud of you. You couldn t be more wrong, Spence.

"(Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Tuesday upheld an Ohio law passed in 2014 that shortened the state’s early voting period and abolished a so-called Golden Week when residents could register and cast ballots in the same week. The 2-1 decision from a panel of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reverses a May ruling by U.S. District Judge Michael Watson who struck down the law that limited early voting, saying it violated voters’ rights. Tuesday’s ruling is the latest in a flurry of legal battles over state voting rules ahead of the Nov. 8 election, including stricter voter identification laws in some states and laws on the voting rights of felons in others. . Ohio has long been a battleground swing state in presidential elections where Democrats and Republicans are tightly matched. Ohio’s Republican-controlled legislature abolished “Golden Week” and shortened early voting to 29 days from 35 days, which critics said directly limited opportunities for minority participation in elections. Civil rights groups the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People had challenged the law, but their arguments were not accepted by the majority opinion at the appeals court. In the ruling on an appeal filed by the state government the judges said Ohio is a national leader when it comes to early voting, allowing people to vote early and in person for four weeks. “This is really quite generous,” the ruling said. The ruling said the challenged law does not result in injury under the Constitution or the Voting Rights Act and that despite the changes, “Ohio continues to provide generous, reasonable, and accessible voting options to all Ohioans.”",1,fakenewsnet,,Appeals court upholds Ohio law that shortens early voting

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. senators called on Congress on Tuesday to take back its authority to determine whether the country goes to war, saying recent U.S. strikes in Syria were not covered by existing authorizations for the use of military force. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has begun considering legislation that would cover military action in Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, Libya and Yemen against the Islamic State, al Qaeda and other Islamist militant groups. “I have always believed that it’s important for Congress to exercise its constitutional role to authorize the use of force,” the committee’s chairman, Republican Senator Bob Corker, told a hearing on Tuesday. As President Donald Trump has ordered stepped-up military activity in Syria, Afghanistan and elsewhere, members of Congress also want Trump to present a strategy for defeating Islamic State and other militant groups. “It’s difficult for us to carry out our responsibility unless we know what the commander in chief needs,” Senator Ben Cardin, the committee’s top Democrat, said. The Trump administration, like former President Barack Obama’s, has been using a 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) against al Qaeda passed after the Sept. 11 attacks as the legal basis for a wide range of military action since. Although there is bipartisan support for Congress to debate and vote on a new AUMF introduced by Republican Senator Jeff Flake and Democratic Senator Tim Kaine, the measure faces stiff opposition. Lawmakers have introduced war authorizations repeatedly in the past several years. But they have failed to advance amid sharp divisions in Congress over whether, or how, to limit commanders’ use of military resources. Many war-weary members of Congress also do not want to vote for anything that might become a foreign military quagmire consuming taxpayer dollars or leading to widespread U.S. casualties. Trump has ordered stepped-up military operations against Islamic State and delegated more authority to his generals. U.S.-led forces said on Tuesday they had shot down an armed “pro-Syrian regime” drone near the border between Iraq and Syria. A U.S. warplane shot down a Syrian army jet over Syria on Sunday. Democratic Senator Tom Udall voted for the 2001 authorization while he was a member of the House of Representatives. “I would have never imagined that vote supporting U.S. troops in Syria in 2017 and engagements with the Assad regime,” he said.",1,fakenewsnet,,Senators want Congress to OK military action in Syria

"ERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) - A delegation from the Kurdistan Regional Government held talks with the Iraqi ruling Shi ite coalition in Baghdad on Saturday, two days before a planned referendum on secession from Iraq. The delegation will discuss the referendum but the referendum is still happening, Hoshiyar Zebari, a top adviser to Kurdish leader Massoud Barzani, told Reuters. We said we would talk to Baghdad before, during and after the referendum. The KRG has said the vote is intended to give its autonomous territory a legitimate mandate to achieve independence from Iraq through dialogue with Baghdad and neighboring powers Turkey and Iran. Ankara and Tehran are worried that the vote could revive the separatist aspirations of their own Kurdish populations. The Kurdish delegation met with representatives of the Shi ite ruling coalition in Baghdad, and with the Iraqi president, Fuad Masum, himself a Kurd, whose role is largely ceremonial. Executive powers are concentrated in the hands of the prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, a Shi ite. Abadi s office said he didn t meet the delegation. Hemin Hawrami, an assistant to Barzani, tweeted: Our delegation in Baghdad to deliver a message: We re ready for talks after 25/9. Turkey said on Saturday it would take security and other steps in response to the planned referendum, which it called a terrible mistake . The Turkish parliament convened for a debate and vote on extending a mandate that authorizes Turkish troop deployments to Iraq and Syria, and Prime Minister Binali Yildirim alluded to possible military moves. The United States has urged the KRG to cancel the vote, while the U.N. Security Council warned in a statement of its potentially destabilizing impact on Iraq. Washington and other Western powers say the vote distracts from the fight against the Islamic State militant group. The KRG counters that its Peshmerga fighters have made a crucial contribution to that fight.

"HELSINKI (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Monday he backed diplomatic efforts to bring an end to the Syrian civil war, which has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives over more than six years of conflict, as Islamic State militants near defeat. Mattis was traveling to Finland to meet with leaders from the Northern Group, a forum for 12 northern European countries, where concern about Russia is growing after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine and gave its backing to eastern Ukraine separatists fighting against the Kiev government. Russia also supports Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and with its help Assad has recovered control of swathes of lost Syrian territory over the last two years and appears militarily unassailable. The United States, however, has supported the opposition to Assad during the Syrian war. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson recently reiterated that Assad should leave power, saying the reign of the Assad family is coming to an end and the only issue is how that should be brought about . Secretary Tillerson engaged strongly with Staffan de Mistura about how do we move what has been going on in Astana, how do we move that over to Geneva where we can actually get the U.N. engaged on the way forward, Mattis told reporters on a plane en route to Finland. Russia has backed peace talks in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan, to end the Syrian civil war. U.N. Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura announced that stalled peace talks between the Syrian government and still-to-be-united opposition would resume in Geneva on Nov. 28. However, Russia is also fighting against Islamic State in Syria, at times their goals aligning with the United States, whose forces have helped Kurdish-led militias recapture Raqqa and other parts of northern and eastern Syria from the militants. With Islamic State s territory rapidly shrinking, the focus was on defeating it in the final few areas, Mattis said - and avoiding conflict as the gap between Russian and U.S. forces shrinks. What the U.S. strategy wills after the defeat of Islamic State is likely to come up when Mattis visits Brussels later this week, where he will meet with his counterparts from NATO. Mattis declined to comment on whether the United States would take back arms from Kurdish YPG fighters after the defeat of Islamic State, a sensitive point given the concerns of its NATO ally Turkey. Ankara views the YPG as an extension of PKK militants waging an insurgency on Turkish soil, and has sharply criticized U.S. support to the group.",1,fakenewsnet,,Mattis backs Geneva process on Syrian conflict

"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A former California state senator accused of taking cash bribes and gifts from a businessman and from undercover FBI agents posing as Hollywood filmmakers to steer legislation in their favor has agreed to plead guilty to mail fraud, federal prosecutors said on Monday. Ronald Calderon, 58, a Democrat indicted in February 2014 on two dozen counts of bribery, fraud, money laundering and other charges, will enter his guilty plea this week, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Los Angeles said. According to the plea agreement, prosecutors have agreed not to ask for a sentence of more than 70 months, although the statutory maximum for the charge is 20 years. Calderon’s attorney, Mark Geragos, could not be reached for comment. The former lawmaker’s brother, former state Assemblyman Thomas Calderon, pleaded guilty last week to a federal money-laundering charge in connection with the case. The Calderon brothers were members of a political dynasty going back several decades in California before they were ensnared in the federal investigation. “The Calderons have acknowledged their roles in a bribery scheme in which money for them and their families alone was driving legislation that would have benefited only a few individuals,” U.S. Attorney Eileen Decker said. The 2014 indictment accused Ronald Calderon of taking bribes from California hospital owner Michael Drobot to preserve a legislative loophole that allowed Drobot to defraud the state’s healthcare system out of hundreds of millions of dollars. According to the plea agreement, filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Monday, Drobot hired Calderon’s son while he was in college, paying him some $30,000 for three summers of work. Drobot has agreed to plead guilty to separate federal charges and is cooperating in the case, prosecutors have said. Calderon was also charged with accepting money from undercover FBI agents, who he thought worked for an independent Hollywood movie studio, in exchange for supporting an expansion of film tax credits in California. According to the plea agreement, Calderon had the undercover agent hire his daughter for $3,000 a month, make a $5,000 payment toward his son’s tuition, pay for $12,000 in Las Vegas trips and give $25,000 to a nonprofit group the lawmaker and his brother used to pay themselves. In exchange, Calderon agreed to vote for the film tax legislation and hire the undercover agent’s purported girlfriend for his staff, according to the plea agreement.",1,fakenewsnet,,Ex-California lawmaker to plead guilty in corruption case: prosecutors
"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - The half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was carrying $100,000 in cash in his backpack at the time of his murder, the police officer investigating the case told a Malaysian court on Wednesday. Indonesian Siti Aisyah, 25, and Doan Thi Huong, 28, a Vietnamese, are charged with murdering Kim Jong Nam by smearing his face with VX, a chemical poison banned by the United Nations, at Kuala Lumpur airport on Feb. 13. The money is now stored in a safe in the office of the police chief of the Sepang district, which has jurisdiction over the murder site, police official Wan Azirul Nizam Che Wan Aziz said. Wan Azirul said he took posession of the victim s blazer, backpack and watch and handed them to the chemistry department for analysis, but was later told by investigation authorities to hand them over to representatives of the North Korean embassy. I do not know why, I was following orders, he added. In court, the prosecution played more than 30 videos of closed-circuit television footage of the women s activities, after Judge Azmi Ariffin overruled defense objections to their admissibility, saying it could be challenged later in the case. The defense lawyers for both Huong and Siti Aisyah said the videos could be considered hearsay, as the investigating officer did not record them himself and was not present to witness the crime. Some of the footage, dated Feb. 11, appeared to show Huong approaching an unidentified man from behind and placing her hands around his neck and face, before backing away slowly with her head slightly lowered and her hands put together. Most of the videos, however, appeared to show Huong and Siti Aisyah before, during and after the attack on Kim Jong Nam. The two women were mostly seen in separate locations, save for during the attack and when they were at a taxi-stand later. The two women were in the same area at the time of the attack, Wan Azirul, who is with the Sepang criminal investigations department, confirmed. The hearing resumes on Thursday, with Wan Azirul returning to the witness stand.",1,fakenewsnet,,"Murdered North Korean Kim Jong Nam had $100,000 in backpack, police witness says"

"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraqi Kurdish political parties opposed to regional leader Masoud Barzani reported attacks on their offices in several cities overnight, hours after Barzani announced his resignation, brought low by a failed push for independence. The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), the Movement for Change and Gorran said in separate statements several of their offices in the Duhok region, north of the Kurdish capital Erbil, were looted or burnt overnight. No casualties were reported. The semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in northern Iraq said it had ordered the local police forces, known as Asayish, to stop the attacks. Barzani, 71, said on Sunday he would give up his position as president on Nov. 1 after an independence referendum he championed in northern Iraq backfired and triggered military and economic retaliation by the Iraqi government. The veteran guerrilla leader has run Iraq s Kurdish autonomous region since 2005, presiding with a firm hand as the region prospered while the rest of Iraq struggled in civil war. But he but has been brought low in recent weeks by his decision to push the independence vote, and his downfall has exposed deep fractures among the Kurds. Armed protesters supporting Barzani stormed parliament as it met on Sunday to approve his resignation. Opposition lawmakers who had been barricaded inside managed to leave later, according to their parties. The PUK, which has been the main rival of Barzani s Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP) for decades, supported his decision to hold the independence referendum, but half-heartedly. The reformist Gorran party opposed the vote, arguing that the timing was poor. In a televised speech announcing his plan to step down, Barzani said followers of his longterm rival, PUK founder Jalal Talabani who died in early October, had been guilty of high treason for handing over the oil city of Kirkuk to Iraqi forces without a fight two weeks ago. Kurdish fighters known as Peshmerga had held Kirkuk, one of Iraq s main oil centres, since 2014 when they seized it after government troops fled in the face of an advance by Islamic State. Although Kirkuk is outside the borders of the Kurdish autonomous region, Kurds consider it the heart of their homeland. This month, Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi ordered his forces to recapture it and all other disputed territory in retaliation after Barzani staged the independence referendum, which Baghdad considers illegal. The Iraqi body in charge of supervising media in Baghdad issued on Sunday a ban on two major Kurdish TV channels close to Barzani s KDP: Rudaw and Kurdistan 24. The Baghdad-based Communication and Media Commission accused the two networks of inciting violence and hatred. This is an assault on freedom of press and expression, replied Erbil-based Kurdistan 24 s management in a letter to the International Federation of Journalists. Rudaw accused Iranian-backed Iraqi paramilitaries who are operating alongside government forces on Monday of killing a Kurdish journalist, Arkan Sharif, in the region of Kirkuk. While the Iraqi Kurds have mostly shown outward unity since the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003, they have a deep history of conflict between Barzani s KDP and Talabani s PUK, which fought each other in a civil war in the 1990s. The KDP is based mostly around Erbil, the regional capital, while the PUK draws its support mostly from Suleimaniya, the other main city in the region. The two political parties run separate units of Peshmerga, their former underground guerrilla armies that have since become the official security forces of the Kurdish autonomous region. After Saddam s fall, Barzani ran the Kurdish autonomous region while his rival Talabani served as ceremonial president of all of Iraq in Baghdad from 2005-2014.",1,fakenewsnet,,Kurdish parties opposed to Barzani report attacks on offices overnight
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Paul Ryan, the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, called on Tuesday for Washington, in parallel with its negotiations with Europe, to pursue a separate free trade agreement with Britain, once it has formally separated from the European Union. Ryan, the highest-ranking elected Republican in the United States, echoed a call from many members of his party, who have dismissed President Barack Obama’s contention that Britain will be at the “back of the queue” for trade talks. Obama issued that warning in April when he intervened to try to persuade Britons to vote to remain in the June 23 referendum on staying or leaving the EU. Free trade agreements require the approval of both houses of the U.S. Congress. Ryan’s Republicans currently control a majority in both the House and Senate. EU and U.S. negotiations had sought to conclude the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) talks before Obama leaves office in January. Although many of his fellow Democrats oppose trade deals as a potential threat to U.S. jobs, Obama has worked with Republicans to pass trade measures. “That is something we should begin discussions with Great Britain to ease concerns so that we do have a smooth trade relationship with Great Britain because they are our indispensable ally,” Ryan said on WISN, a radio station in his home state Wisconsin. The remarks were distributed by Ryan’s office in Washington. Some trade experts have said that a deal on TTIP is unlikely for years now without Britain at the table, which could open an opportunity for a separate deal with Britain.",1,fakenewsnet,,Republican Ryan wants trade talks with Britain

"NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team has been actively considering ways to revamp a temporary visa program used to bring foreign workers to the United States to fill high-skilled jobs, according to sources familiar with the discussions. Possibilities for reforming the distribution of H-1B visas, which are used largely by the tech industry, were discussed at a meeting last month with chief executives of tech companies at Trump Tower, said two sources, who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to talk about the closed-door talks. DON’T MISS Pharma grapples with drug price backlash DOJ to examine FBI actions in Clinton email probe Trump senior policy adviser Stephen Miller proposed scrapping the existing lottery system used to award the visas. A possible replacement system would favor visa petitions for jobs that pay the highest salaries, according to the sources. H-1B visas are intended for foreign nationals in “specialty” occupations that generally require higher education, which according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) includes, but is not limited to, scientists, engineers or computer programmers. The government awards 65,000 every year. Companies say they use them to recruit top talent. But a majority of the visas are awarded to outsourcing firms, sparking criticism by skeptics that say those firms use the visas to fill lower-level information technology jobs. Critics also say the lottery system benefits outsourcing firms that flood the system with mass applications. The H-1B visa program tends to be more critical to outsourcing firms than U.S. tech firms. For instance, more than 60 percent of the U.S. employees of Indian outsourcing firm Infosys (INFY.NS) are H-1B holders, and the company in its annual report has cited an increase in visa costs as among factors that could hurt its profitability. The top 10 recipients of H-1B visas in 2015 were all outsourcing firms, according to government data compiled by the IEEE-USA, a professional organization representing U.S. engineers. Sixty-five percent of H-1B petitions approved in the 2014 fiscal year went to tech workers, mostly from India, according to USCIS. In several high-profile cases, American workers were asked to train H-1B holders to do their jobs before being laid off themselves. The idea advanced by Miller in the tech meeting has also been pushed by the IEEE-USA. Miller previously served as a staffer for Senator Jeff Sessions, Trump’s pick for attorney general, who has been an outspoken critic of abuses of the H-1B program. Trump, who has applied for H-1B visas to bring in foreign workers to his own businesses sent mixed messages about the program on the campaign trail. He assailed it for taking jobs from U.S. workers, but during a Republican debate last March said he was “softening” his position “because we have to have talented people in this country.” He later issued a statement on his website saying he would “end forever the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program.” Trump businesses, like Trump National Golf Club and Trump Model Management, have received permission to bring in more than two dozen foreign employees on H-1B visas since 2011, according to Department of Labor data. During the meeting last month in New York, Trump seemed to be searching for middle ground, and members of his transition team raised specific proposals, the two sources said. A third source familiar with the talks said the Trump team has also discussed the plan to change the lottery system internally. There were more than a dozen top tech executives from some of the country’s largest tech companies, including Google (GOOGL.O), Facebook (FB.O) and Apple (AAPL.O), present at the meeting. Microsoft (MSFT.O) CEO Satya Nadella said technology companies need to be able to recruit talent from abroad when necessary. Trump seemed open to modifying the H-1B program, the sources said. He said he wanted to stop “bad people” from immigrating to the United States, not “great people,” according to one account of the meeting. Among proposals the group discussed was raising the cost of applications from large companies as a way to discourage bulk filing for the visas. Asked by Trump if they would object to that, none of the tech CEOs said they would. “In our view, the president-elect is not hostile to H-1B visas,” said one of the sources familiar with discussions at the meeting. While Trump could initiate some changes to the visa program with executive action, significant shifts would likely need to go through a lengthy formal rulemaking process, said Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration expert at Cornell Law School. Major changes would likely be subject to court challenges, he said. Other reforms, like changing the visa cap or offering more green cards to high-tech workers, could require Congressional action, Yale-Loehr said. A wide variety of companies, including Thomson Reuters (TRI.TO), use the H-1B visa program to bring in employees from abroad.",1,fakenewsnet,,"Trump, tech tycoons talk overhaul of H1B visas"

"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - I first visited Camp No. 3 a few days after the Sept. 19 earthquake. After reporting from collapsed buildings around the city, this was a different type of shock. Row after row of tiny tin shacks crammed into a small lot hidden behind a high fence in the middle class neighborhood of Lindavista. Here, hundreds of families who lost their homes in an earthquake 32 years ago are living in deplorable conditions, with children and grandchildren born during the interminable wait for promised government-subsidized homes. The 1985 earthquake was a defining moment for the Mexican capital. The death toll is still disputed, but at least 5,000 were killed. Some say many more died. Three decades on, hundreds of its victims are still living in hovels in encampments across the sprawling city of 20 million and now the latest quake has made thousands more people homeless. On first impression the camp is a little menacing, the smell of marijuana hangs in the air and residents warn of thieves and petty crime they blame on new arrivals - people who have moved in to occupy shacks left by families who have received new homes. A strong sense of community prevails among the 1985 earthquake survivors, necessary perhaps for families who share outdoor toilets and use bared electric cables to heat water to bathe. And as I have seen among many of Latin America s poorest people, there is resourcefulness. Most families had some kind of work, many setting up small businesses like food stands selling tacos, or makeshift photocopy shops on the roadside. One woman made her living charging for toilet paper and access to a bathroom. According to the leaders of the Lindavista camp, its ramshackle shacks are home to around 750 people, divided into roughly 250 families. There are almost 200 children who are the grandchildren of those originally resettled here, according to local leaders. At least six such camps exist in the capital. Mexico City s housing institute said that since 2016, it has delivered 173 homes to victims of the 1985 quake and expects to hand over 120 more before the end of next year.

"(Reuters) - Democratic U.S. Senator Edward Markey of Massachusetts said on Monday he placed a hold on President Barack Obama’s nominee to head the Food and Drug Administration until the agency agrees to reform its process for approving opioid painkillers. Markey wants opioid-approval matters to be reviewed by an FDA advisory committee and believes the committee should consider the risk of addiction and abuse during the approval process. He also wants the agency to rescind approval of OxyContin for children and convene an advisory panel to guide that process. “Last year, the FDA approved a new pediatric use for OxyContin without convening an advisory committee even though its guidelines note that FDA decisions that relate to controversial issues or matters relating to children are particularly well-suited to advisory committee empanelment,” Markey said in a statement. A “hold” is a procedure by which a senator can prevent a measure from being voted on by the full Senate. The nominee, Dr. Robert Califf, a cardiologist and researcher, is widely expected to be approved when the Senate votes on the nomination later this year, although critics argue his ties to the pharmaceutical industry are too close. A spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the FDA, said it had made addressing the opioid crisis “a top priority.” “Work at FDA and across HHS will continue on this important effort,” spokesman Kevin Griffis said in a statement. “HHS will be in touch directly with the Senator regarding his concern.” The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions voted earlier this month to confirm Califf as FDA commissioner, a position open since Dr. Margaret Hamburg stepped down last February. Califf, who joined the FDA a year ago as a deputy commissioner, previously held senior positions at Duke University, where he founded a large academic research center that received more than half its funding from the drug industry. He has also led multiple large-scale, company-funded clinical trials and published more than 1,200 papers. His interest in streamlining the clinical trial process dovetails with those of patient groups and members of Congress who are eager to see new drugs brought to market faster. U.S. deaths from drug overdoses hit a record in 2014, increasing 6.5 percent to 47,055, propelled by prescription painkiller and heroin abuse, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Drug overdoses are seen as a major contributor to recently rising death rates among middle-aged white Americans. Since 2000, deaths from powerful, highly addictive opioids have jumped 200 percent, the CDC said, with those addicted to prescription painkillers, such as hydrocodone, increasingly turning to widely available, often cheaper heroin.",1,fakenewsnet,,Senator Markey places hold on Obama's nominee to lead FDA

"On Trump s birthday, the Washington Post published an explosive story alleging that the FBI under Mueller s direction was currently investigating Trump for obstruction of justice for his treatment of former FBI director James Comey.The special counsel overseeing the investigation into Russia s role in the 2016 election is interviewing senior intelligence officials as part of a widening probe that now includes an examination of whether President Trump attempted to obstruct justice, officials said.The move by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III to investigate Trump s conduct marks a major turning point in the nearly year-old FBI investigation, which until recently focused on Russian meddling during the presidential campaign and on whether there was any coordination between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin. Investigators have also been looking for any evidence of possible financial crimes among Trump associates, officials said.Trump has no one to blame for this new line of inquiry but himself. In testimony his staff hasn t even bothered denying, Comey noted that Trump once asked everyone to leave the room before directly asking the FBI director if he could find a way to drop the Russia investigation. Then Trump fired Comey when the investigation continued. Then he went into an interview with NBC s Lester Holt and explicitly admitted that he fired Comey because he wouldn t stop investigating his connections to Russia.Rather than make his problems go away, firing Comey and Trump s subsequent confession seem to have triggered a new investigation this time in his attempts to obstruct justice by interrupting the investigative process.Despite the avalanche of evidence against him, Trump s team had a painfully predictable response: To accuse the Washington Post of lying. In the hours after publishing, Trump staff and friends repeatedly claimed there was no investigation into Trump. They screamed fake news. The chairwoman of the RNC went further, claiming Mueller had smeared Trump with unfounded accusations. (Hint: Mueller hasn t even commented publicly yet. And an investigation isn t an accusation. )Mueller's unfounded accusation against @POTUS changes nothing. There's still no proof of obstruction of justice.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Wednesday took its first step in replacing Obama-era banking regulators, naming a veteran financial lawyer as interim head of the watchdog for federally chartered banks. Keith Noreika, a partner at law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, will be first deputy comptroller at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and will run the OCC on an interim basis when Comptroller Thomas Curry leaves on May 5, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement. Former banker Joseph Otting, who worked with Mnuchin at Californian lender OneWest, is considered the lead contender to permanently replace Curry, several people familiar with the matter have said. That appointment requires Senate confirmation and analysts said they expected Noreika to be in charge for much of this year. U.S. President Donald Trump wants to overhaul regulation of the financial services system to make it easier for banks to lend and has asked Mnuchin to review the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law by June 3. The OCC is one of several regulators that monitors the health of Wall Street banks but has a particularly influential role in scrutinizing lending practices. Under Curry, OCC bank examiners have clamped down on what they perceive as overly risky loans, particularly the type used to fund private equity buyouts. Curry used his position to warn banks when he thought they were talking on too much risk in loans to energy firms and property developers. “Curry did use the bully pulpit to warn banks against risky activity and I think you’re likely to see less of that going forward,” said Ian Katz, financial policy analyst at research firm Capital Alpha. The appointment of Noreika and the expected nomination of Otting meant limits on how much banks can lend to highly indebted companies may be loosened in the future, said Jaret Seiberg, analyst at Cowen Washington Research Group. “This is the most bullish sign yet for the biggest banks that the Trump administration will pursue a traditional Republican approach of financial regulation rather than adopt a more populist tone that could include high leverage capital requirements,” Seiberg said. Trump’s plans to overhaul regulation are being held up by the government’s current lean crew of regulators. While the Senate voted on Tuesday to confirm attorney Jay Clayton to head the Securities and Exchange Commission, the OCC’s changing of the guard might not be so smooth. Democrats have criticized practices at OneWest, the lender created by Mnuchin after the 2008 housing crisis that foreclosed on 36,000 California families. Mnuchin hired Otting as chief executive of the bank in 2010 and he held that role until it was bought by CIT Group in 2014. Noreika’s background as a lawyer who has advised banks on M&A, including Ant Financial’s acquisition of Moneygram, as well as on the Volcker Rule, which prohibits banks from making speculative bets, is also controversial. “It is disturbing that the President is rushing to replace Mr. Curry with an acting appointee who has clear conflicts of interest, and lacks any experience in running such an important agency,” Ohio Democrat Sherrod Brown, the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, said in a statement. Noreika’s appointment does not require Senate approval. Curry, a career regulator, was appointed by the Obama administration for a five-year term that expired last month and has since been serving under an extension. While Curry took a tough line on risky lending, the agency did come under fire for its failure to tackle a sales practice abuse scandal at Wells Fargo & Co. The OCC is also trying to establish itself as a regulator of online lenders and financial technology firms. State authorities have argued that is their job and are suing the OCC, arguing it lacks the legal authority to offer a banking charter for technology companies. There are also three vacant spots on the Federal Reserve Board, including the post of vice chair of supervision, which will play a key role in any overhaul of bank regulation. Earlier on Wednesday, Mnuchin told a conference of community bankers that Trump had signed off on a nominee to fill the vice chair role but did not name the person. Reuters had previously reported that Randal Quarles, who worked as under secretary for domestic finance at the Treasury under President George W. Bush, was a leading candidate. Mnuchin said the administration was also close to naming the two other Fed selections.",1,fakenewsnet,,Changes at helm of U.S. bank agency signal new Trump era
"Sounds great how about a new car?An immigrant-rights group proposed a Bill of Rights for illegal immigrants Thursday, demanding that Americans recognize there are millions already in the country who deserve health care, in-state tuition rates for college and a guarantee of citizenship in the long term.The list of demands runs 10 items long the same as the U.S. Constitution s Bill of Rights and also calls for an end to arrests and deportations for all law-abiding undocumented Americans. The document was circulated by United We Stay, which is a group of illegal immigrants, first generation Americans and human rights activists pushing for changes to immigration law. We know we have human rights, even though our very presence is deemed illegal and our existence alien. Now we have our own Bill of Rights and we want it to be the framework for every immigration decision going forward from the local to the national level, the group said in a statement announcing their demands.The 10 points include a demand that they be accorded respect; calls for citizenship rights and an immediate deferment of deportations; in-state tuition at public colleges; wage equality ; medical care; and protection against deportation if illegal immigrants report a crime as a witness.The list also includes a specific demand for compelled authorization of birth certificates for our U.S.-born children. That appears to be pushback against the state of Texas, where officials have ruled that parents must present valid ID to get children s birth certificates and have deemed the Mexican government s Matricula Consular ID card not to be acceptable as primary identification.A federal court has allowed that Texas policy to go into effect, ruling that there are questions about the reliability of the Mexican cards and that state officials have an interest in making sure only authorized relatives are able to get birth certificates.The list of rights begins with a protest against the terms illegal and alien. Immigrant-rights advocates say both terms are dehumanizing, and have offered undocumented workers or, in the case of United We Stand, Undocumented Americans, as their preferred term.The document is meant to serve as a goalpost for the ongoing immigration debate. Immigrant-rights groups had been gaining ground in recent years, with polls suggesting Americans were increasingly open to legalization.A legalization bill even passed the Senate in 2013 but Democrats, who controlled the chamber, never sent it to the GOP-run House for action.The issue then stalled last year after President Obama took unilateral action to grant a deportation amnesty to as many as 5 million of the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants in the U.S. Federal courts have put that amnesty on hold, but Mr. Obama s other policies stopping deportations for most illegal immigrants remain in place, which has effectively checked off one of the list of rights demands.

"CHICAGO (Reuters) - London’s first Muslim mayor, Sadiq Khan, voiced support for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton on Thursday, warning that anti-Muslim views like those espoused by Republican Donald Trump “plays into the hands” of Islamic State. During a stop in Chicago on his first visit to the United States, Khan said he was “a big fan” of Clinton and hoped she would win the presidential election in November. “She’s arguably the most experienced candidate to run to be the president,” Khan told reporters following a speech to more than 250 academics, diplomats and business people. “As the father of two daughters, I think the message it sends when the most powerful politician in the world is a woman is phenomenal, and hope she wins,” said Khan, who as mayor of London is arguably one the most influential member of his faith in western Europe. Immediately after taking office in May, Khan tangled with Trump over his proposed ban on allowing Muslim immigrants and refugees into America, deriding his plan as “ignorant.” During his roughly 45-minute speech before the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, Khan did not mention Trump by name but attacked the positions the New York developer has staked, such as tightening Muslim immigration into the United States. “I think to suggest somehow that Muslims aren’t welcome in the U.S.A., to suggest somehow that being a Muslim isn’t compatible with being western, unintentionally plays into the hands of daesh or so-called ISIS,” Khan said. Trump has offered an evolving stance on Muslim immigration into the United States since his original December 2015 call for a ban on Muslims entering the country. Earlier this summer, he voiced support for limiting the ban to only countries with known terrorist links. Last month, he appeared to moderate somewhat on an outright ban by touting the idea of the United States undertaking “extreme vetting” of incoming Muslim immigrants, refugees or visitors.",1,fakenewsnet,,London's Muslim mayor backs Clinton for U.S. president

"A 43-year-old man with a surgically implanted bionic penis is set to actually use it for the first time. Mohammed Abad, from Edinburgh, will take the life changing step next week with 35-year-old sex worker Charlotte Rose after they get to know each other when they go on a dinner date in London. Abad lost his organ as a result of a freak road side accident and was fitted with a bionic one that apparently allows him to perform. Abad said: I have waited long enough for this it ll be a great start to the new year. My penis is working perfectly now so I just want to do it. I m really excited. I can t wait for it to finally happen. [youtube he was six, Abad was pushed into a road and fell under a moving car which dragged him 600 feet resulting in serious injuries, including to his genitals. He was fitted with a bionic replacement in 2012 but it s only been fully functional since 2015, when surgeons performed a special operation which will apparently allow him to have intercourse. Here is how the device works: The sexual device contains two tubes which fill up using liquid from his stomach, allowing him to maintain an erection. The contraption complete with on and off buttons in his testicles to pump it up or deflate it was made from the flesh of his arm and fitted by surgeons at University College London. It has a button in his testicles which he can press to pump it up, as well as another button which drains the penis after use, so it deflates. Here is how the gadget was attached: Molding and attaching it took three years, with doctors from University College London using a skin graft from his arm to line its shaft. The skin and fat from his forearm was removed to create the new penis, which was then attached during an 11-hour operation. Along with giving him a sex life it has also allowed him to pass urine standing up for the first time. It took surgeons at University College London three years to mold Mohammed Abad s new penis using skin taken from his arm. However, it wasn t that simple. Abad said that he s had some complications as a result of the surgery: I got out of hospital on the 10th of July and got a train back up to Scotland. I had to keep it erect for two weeks. I had to do that for it to heal, because that s the way it works. My old penis didn t go to waste my surgeon used it to make my scrotum. In the last three years, Abad has had 119 operations. But that s not stopping him. His soon-to-be partner Charlotte Rose, who s a campaigner for sexual freedom and a dominatrix, said that that she is honored that Abad picked her and that she will not charge him. Abed, who was married for over two years, never told his wife that he didn t have a penis until their wedding night. She would later leave him. Rose said that she hopes that Abad will have more confidence after he loses his virginity.Hopefully everything will work out for Abad and he can be on his way to living a normal life.",0,fakenewsnet,, 43-Year-Old Virgin With Bionic Penis Set To Have Sex For First Time (VIDEO)

That is disqualifying right there. To say you don t know about the Ku Klux Klan? Scarborough said. You don t know about David Duke? On Sunday, Trump acknowledged his heavy support from white supremacists, including former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke, but said it would be unfair to renounce the White Power Rangers supporting him until he has more information. Just so you understand, I don t know anything about David Duke, OK? Trump told CNN s Jake Tapper. I don t know anything about what you re even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists. I have to look at the group. I mean, I don t know what group you re talking about, he added despite Tapper s repeated clarifications that he was talking about the Ku Klux Klan. You wouldn t want me to condemn a group that I know nothing about. I d have to look. Scarborough called this course of action stunning in that it isn t buying him a single vote : I mean is he really so stupid that he thinks Southerners aren t offended by the Ku Klux Klan and David Duke? Is he really so ignorant of Southern voters that he thinks this is the way to their heart to go neutral, to play Switzerland when you re talking about the Klan?

"A recent opinion poll carried out by NBC News/Wall Street Journal showed that 78 percent of Americans, a number that appears to still be growing, would prefer to see an independent commissioner or special prosecutor handle the investigation into Russia s interference in the 2016 US presidential election, while a mere 15 percent believe congress can handle any ongoing probe.Last week was more than just a turbulent time in Washington. President Trump fired FBI head James Comey on Tuesday, the man responsible for the investigation into Trump s Russian ties. This latest poll was conducted between Thursday, May 11 and Saturday, May 13, just days after Comey s ousting, among 800 adults and has an overall margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. The firing of the FBI director was a major upheaval in the investigation process, and these poll results reflect the current climate not only around Capitol Hill, but what is a rapidly growing consensus across the nation.Since Comey s dismissal, Trump and several members of his administration have tried to downplay the need for an independent commission to continue what the FBI had begun; looking into questions of Russian interference in last year s election, as well as the possibility of members of Trump s campaign colluding with Moscow. In fact, on Saturday the President stated in no uncertain terms that the investigation should continue to progress in the House, the Senate, the FBI. According to the same poll, only 29 percent of Americans say they approve of Comey s firing, while 38 percent disapprove. Another 32 percent of respondents don t have enough to say on the matter, yet among those who say they have read, seen or heard a lot about the firing, 53 percent say they disapprove, versus 33 percent who approve. The poll also showed a partisan split when it comes to the topic of the president s decision, with 58 percent of Republicans approving while 66 percent of Democrats disapprove of the move. One thing that is clear, however, is that very few people surveyed had no opinion at all, with low single-digit responses.As a whole, Trump s approval rating has remained steady at 39 percent since last Tuesday, however, 30 percent of those surveyed claimed that their impression of the president is less favorable since his decision to remove James Comey, while 61 percent say the move hasn t impacted their impression of President Trump whatsoever.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",0,fakenewsnet,, The Polls From Trump’s Horrific Week Have Been Released And He’s In A Complete Tailspin

"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The leaders of Mexico and Canada on Thursday pledged to work toward a renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) even as talks taking place in the United States turned sour due to hard-line U.S. demands. Speaking in Mexico City as a fourth round of talks to rehash NAFTA was held near Washington, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said they were committed to a “win-win-win” deal. The talks in the United States hit obstacles, with tensions increasing dramatically Thursday due to U.S. demands that include adding a so-called “sunset clause” to NAFTA that would force negotiations of the $1 trillion pact every five years. Two sources with direct knowledge of the talks in Arlington, Virginia described the atmosphere as “horrible” and highly charged. “We will not be walking away from the table based on the proposals put forward,” Trudeau said at a news conference in response to a question about whether the clause was a poison pill for the talks. Asked whether bilateral deals were possible if talks failed, Pena Nieto said Mexico would keep working with both Canada and the United States to reach a deal that was beneficial for all three countries, but he suggested there could be other ways to move forward. “I think that Canada and Mexico share that the NAFTA agreement is a good mechanism, not the only one, but it is a good mechanism to boost the development of the region,” Pena Nieto said. U.S. President Donald Trump says NAFTA, originally signed in 1994, has been a disaster for the United States and he has frequently threatened to scrap it unless major changes are made. Besides the sunset clause, the United States also wants to modify dispute settlement mechanisms and boost the amount of U.S. content that autos must contain to qualify for tax-free status. Business leaders from all three countries have said the U.S. proposals could derail the talks. Earlier on Thursday Mexican Finance Minister Jose Antonio Meade said Mexico was analyzing tariffs and import substitution plans in case NAFTA was scrapped. “We have the possibility of identifying tariff measures, we have the possibility to identify other markets to be our providers and other markets that we can turn to,” Meade told senators in the capital. “We’re working on that, we have been working and perfecting the analysis to identify not only industries but companies that could help the contingency if we don’t reach a satisfactory negotiation.” Meade did not give details of what tariffs were being analyzed. In 2011, Mexico successfully used targeted tariffs on U.S. goods such as pork and cheese to win a dispute over trucks. Meade’s comments and the tensions at the talks drove the peso to a nearly five-month low of 18.92 against the dollar, a fall of more than 1 percent in the session. The currency has shed close to 4 percent since Oct. 3 on concerns the NAFTA talks could founder.",1,fakenewsnet,,"Canada, Mexico vow to stick with NAFTA talks, Mexico works on Plan B"

"Jared Kushner, who is Ivanka Trump s husband and therefore King Donnie s son-in-law, played the good son-in-law by stepping up and boldly defending His Royal Anti-Semite s anti-Semitic tweet against Hillary, just like everyone else who thinks the whole brouhaha is just political correctness run amok. The problem is, he did so by invoking his Jewish grandparents history in the Holocaust, and now his family is rightfully livid at him for it.Because really, he s going to defend an anti-Semitic image by saying his grandparents are Holocaust survivors so he knows better than the evil media what is and isn t anti-Semitic? Where has he been living that he thinks this is okay? In a bubble that s under a rock, which is deep in a cave in the middle of the Himalayas?Marc Kushner, Jared s first cousin, responded to this brown-nosing butt-fuckery with a link to Jared s op-ed, and this simple statement at the top: I have a different take-away from my Grandparents experience in the war. It is our responsibility as the next generation to speak up against hate. Anti-semitism or otherwise. It was Jacob Schulder, another cousin, though, that really let loose on both Jared and the Anti-Semite-in-Chief with a comment that appears to have since been deleted, but that Politico still has: When an out of touch with reality nominee hires an out of touch with reality campaign manager, who is also a son -in- law, you get the BS Jared wrote. I don t think Trump is an anti Semite; I think he s a lying idiot (among other things) with little to no experiences outside his teetering fiefdom of failed development projects, divorces, bankrupted sports leagues, fraudulent Universities and golf courses (and the list keeps going). The very first thing a responsible campaign manager should do, I d think, and I mean the very first thing, would be to take away his father- in -law s Twitter account. Even Joseph Kushner would ve had the street smarts to figure that one out while living on boiled potatoes in the forest. Schulder went on to explain exactly how the rest of us know that this was no accident, and King Dunce isn t the least bit sorry, so it ll probably happen again: That my grandparents have been dragged into this is a shame. Thank you Jared for using something sacred and special to the descendants of Joe and Rae Kushner to validate the sloppy manner in which you ve handled this campaign. From the references to Palestine at the AIPAC conference (which got Donald jeered) to the justification of the itchy Twitter fingers your father in law has, you ve managed to further prove what so many of us have known for many years. Kudos to you for having gone this far no one expected this. But for the sake of the family name, which may have no meaning to you but still has meaning to others, please don t invoke our grandparents in vain just so you can sleep better at night. It is self serving and disgusting. So what did he say that was so offensive? In an op-ed posted to Observer.com on Wednesday, Kushner said: [T]he worst that his detractors can fairly say about him is that he has been careless in retweeting imagery that can be interpreted as offensive. He then launched into a narrative of his grandparents history of trying to escape the Nazis in Russia, and some of the horrors they endured while doing so. His grandmother did escape and joined a resistance cell, where she met his grandfather, who had been living in a literal hole in the ground for three years, trying to remain hidden from the Nazis. Then he said: I go into these details, which I have never discussed, because it s important to me that people understand where I m coming from when I report that I know the difference between actual, dangerous intolerance versus these labels that get tossed around in an effort to score political points. Where he s coming from? Oh, that s right, he s coming from His Royal Racism s rear end in the same manner as diarrhea. The thing is, using the Star of David in the manner of that tweet, along with the fact that it originally came from neo-Nazis, is intentionally anti-Semitic. This was no accident of ignorance in any way, shape or form, and someone with family that survived the Holocaust should know a lot better than this.But Kushner has drunk the Kool-Aid mixed by King Dunce himself, and is brainwashed into believing that the Serial-Racist-Tweeter-in-Chief can t possibly be that hateful and bigoted. With that explanation out of the way, the only one left is that the tweet was not anti-Semitic, and Trump is just a little careless.Please.Of course, a source close to Kushner says that he hasn t even spoken to these people in ten years, so they don t matter. That s a bunch of bull cookies right there. Kushner may not have spoken to them in ten years, but he invoked his history, which is their history too, in a public forum. Therefore, it matters. End of.The entire campaign is rife with broad racism, which includes anti-Semitism. Trump has a bad habit of retweeting white supremacists, including neo-Nazi groups. Kushner shouldn t be telling anybody that the anti-Semitic tweet was a mere mistake, especially not if he s going to insult his own family, and their Jewish history, in doing so.Featured image by Neilson Barnard/Getty Images for FINCA",0,fakenewsnet,, Trump’s Son-In-Law OBLITERATED By His Jewish Family After Defending Trump’s Anti-Semitic Tweet

"MAIDUGURI, Nigeria (Reuters) - Suicide bomb attackers killed 10 people and wounded 30 in the northeast Nigerian city of Maiduguri on Wednesday, an emergency agency official said. Islamist militant group Boko Haram has killed more than 20,000 people since 2009 as part of its attempt to create an Islamic state in the Lake Chad basin. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the latest attack, which emergency officials and members of a government-approved vigilante group said was carried out by four female bombers in the Muna Garage district of Maiduguri at about 06:00 p.m. (1700 GMT). The use of female bombers is a hallmark of Boko Haram attacks. We have so far recorded 10 people s deaths and about 30 victims injured, said Bello Dambatta, a spokesman for the State Emergency Agency (SEMA). Maiduguri is the capital of Borno state and the city worst hit by the jihadist insurgency. At least 221 people have been killed in bombings and gun attacks in northeast Nigeria since June, according to a Reuters tally.",1,fakenewsnet,,Suicide bombers kill 10 in Nigeria's Maiduguri: emergency official

But gun control advocates are expecting the new actions to be revealed next week, ahead of Obama s annual State of the Union address, set for January 12.The White House wouldn t comment directly on the exact timing or content of Obama s executive orders. White House spokesman Eric Schultz said that the President expected a set of recommendations on unilateral action to arrive at the beginning of the year.Plans began to become clearer on New Year s Day with a White House announcement accompanying Obama s weekly address that on Monday the president would meet with Lynch.

"Sounds like a great deal, right? After all, Planned Parenthood insists that only 3% of its business involves abortions, and they get $500 million from the federal government. That way, they could focus that much more on all their work in pre-natal care! And yet The White House, concerned about the possible political repercussions of the Republican effort to defund Planned Parenthood, has proposed preserving federal payments to the group if it discontinues providing abortions.The proposal, which was never made formally, has been rejected as an impossibility by officials at Planned Parenthood, which receives about $500 million annually in federal funding. That money helps pay for women s health services the organization provides, not for abortion services. Let s be clear: Federal funds already do not pay for abortions, Dawn Laguens, the executive vice president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said on Monday. Offering money to Planned Parenthood to abandon our patients and our values is not a deal that we will ever accept. Providing critical health care services for millions of American women is nonnegotiable. This deal seems pretty straightforward, even if the White House never quite made it official. Planned Parenthood wants to keep receiving Title IX funds intended for low-income women who need actual health care that could be provided by other clinics, especially those which offer actual pre-natal health care. If that was the case, they could get rid of the supposed three percent of their business that deals with abortions and use those resources to expand other offerings, including services they already claim to do but don t actually provide at all. Their refusal to even consider the idea speaks volumes about their values, as do their abortion sales quotas.Their annual report shows overall revenue at $1.146 billion, which includes $553.7 million from government funds, and only $309.2 million from non-government health services revenue fees. If abortions only amount to 3% of their revenue, that would be $34.38 million for 332,000 abortions, or $103 per abortion (gross, not net after costs) if no other revenue was being used to cover it. These numbers don t add up with the 3% claim.Trump s deal makes this much clear, at least: Planned Parenthood values its abortion mill much more than it values $500 million in government funding each year. That really tells us all we need to know about their 3% claim, their values, and the use of taxpayer dollars to subsidize the operations of the world s leading abortion mill. TownhallBy now, Femi-Nazi s are probably starting to get the idea that they re not dealing with your average spineless politician. Time to pull out the pussy hats and take to the streets ladies. As a conservative woman, I can assure you that the recent women s march (anti-Trump, pro-abortion publicity stunt) was an epic fail. Pro-life female supporters of President Trump are pretty much in agreement that it was the best imaginable way to convince more people to join our team.

"In an amazing take down of Cliven Bundy s terrorist spawn, Fox News host Megyn Kelly explained how the law works and gave the right-wing loon just enough rope to hang himself with on live television.During the Monday night edition of The Kelly File, Ammon Bundy appeared on the show to defend the armed takeover of a federal wildlife building in Oregon in protest of a pair of ranchers being sent to prison for setting fire to federal land.Bundy made an oft-repeated claim that the federal government has no legal authority under the Constitution to own land. As usual, Bundy is just another right-wing extremist who is totally wrong about the law.According to the Property Clause of the Constitution: The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States. Politifact has also rated this claim as pants on fire in the past. As their final verdict states:The underlying legal argument rests on a tenuous interpretation of constitutional language and the rejection of about 125 years of Supreme Court decisions. The legal scholars we reached, regardless of any political leanings they might have, agreed that the Constitution clearly grants Washington the power to own land and that arguments to the contrary are baseless.Despite this, poor Megyn Kelly had to sit and listen as an ignorant fool tried to explain his argument to her. Keep in mind that Kelly is a trained attorney.Prior to letting Bundy embarrass himself, Kelly destroyed the idea that the prosecution of Dwight and Steven Hammond was illegal. The Hammonds set fire to federal land and a court of law found them guilty and they were sentenced to five years in prison. The United States Attorney General charged them for burning 139 acres of federal public land that the Hammonds had leased for grazing in order to cover up the illegal killing of several deer.The Hammonds appealed their case all the way to the Supreme Court and lost and surrendered themselves to authorities after denouncing Bundy s group of armed domestic terrorists. You know the argument on the other side, Kelly said. These ranchers who you support but are not directly involved [with] had their day in court. They were found guilty, and it went all the way up to the US Supreme Court, which denied their appeal. Isn t that the way it s supposed to work in our country when it comes to the rule of law? Bundy dodged the question by trying to ask Kelly a question, which she refused to answer because she asks the questions on her show. And that led to Bundy bumbling his way through arguing that the federal government can t own land.Kelly then changed the topic to Bundy s brother Ryan and remarks he made to the Oregonian newspaper that he was prepared to kill and be killed for the cause. Well, Ammon Bundy walked that back in quite a hurry, suggesting that his band of gun-toting rednecks are just putting on an act. Well, I have a family. I have six children, a beautiful wife. I have a wonderful home. I have a business, several employees. I m not here to die. I m here to defend my freedoms and my liberties, and will I? Yes. But it s not going to come to that. Here s the video via Raw Story.In short, it appears the right-wing gun nuts are all talk and no walk. They were just hoping the federal government would react but the group has received nothing but ridicule from all sides. Even Ted Cruz is urging them to end the pathetic standoff. And after this on-air schooling by Megyn Kelly, it looks like the ridicule is only going to make these ammosexuals an even bigger punchline.Featured image via video screen capture",0,fakenewsnet,, Fox News Host Megyn Kelly Completely Embarrasses Traitorous Bundy Terrorist (VIDEO)

"It started out as an observation, then it turned into a joke, and but it s become downright insulting. Each time America suffers from another horrific mass shooting, Republicans in Congress send their thoughts and prayers and do absolutely nothing else. Rather than work towards solutions, conservative politicians have found that merely saying a prayer before bed somehow absolves them of their reprehensible inaction towards gun violence.And Dallas Police Chief David Brown, like so many of us, is absolutely fed up.At a press conference updating the country about the investigation into the ambush of police officers in Dallas following a peaceful anti-police brutality march, he didn t remain silent about the culpability of Congress. In short, Chief Brown has had a lot of long days trying to fulfill his obligation to the public and get answers, but he s noticed lawmakers can t say the same. It s been business as usual and that means no business on finding solutions to mass shootings.Dallas Police Chief Brown to Congress: Do your job pic.twitter.com/rhhoWPKSVX Colin Jones July 11, 2016Brown is not alone. Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings (D) recently pointed out something that conservatives had hoped would go unnoticed: Open Carry, the movement that allows Texans the right to carry AR-15s nearly anywhere in public, didn t help during the police ambush, and actually made everything much, much worse. Rawlings said Dallas police Chief David Brown told him that people running through the shooting scene with rifles and body armor required officers to track them down and bring them to the police department. Whether that was time that could have been spent trying to find and stop the shooter is something police will have to comment on. Major Max Geron of the Dallas PD didn t mind answering that question: There was also the challenge of sorting out witnesses from potential suspects. Texas is an open carry state, and there were a number of armed demonstrators taking part. There was confusion on the radio about the description of the suspects and whether or not one or more was in custody. Dallas police have every right to feel frustrated and sickened by the response from both their state Republican Party and the ones in Washington, D.C. Law enforcement agencies have repeatedly warned pro-gun lawmakers that these fanatical pushes to put guns in every citizen s hands and in every corner of public life means putting both civilians and cops at risk. It makes policing harder. It makes mass murder easier. And it makes the lines between good guy with a gun and bad guy with a gun impossible to separate.To be clear, Democrats need to bear some responsibility for inaction as well. After massacres at Sandy Hook and Aurora, there was motivation from Americans to finally fix this problem and Democrats let it slip through their fingers. Following Orlando, progressive lawmakers seemed to show signs that enough was enough, but they need to keep at it.The way forward is simple: Congress needs to put the lives of American citizens above the rights of an AR-15.

"(Please note: profanity in sixth paragraph) By Isla Binnie ROME (Reuters) - A bloody attack on a journalist has prompted outrage in Italy and put the spotlight on suspected links between extreme right-wing politicians and organized crime in a notoriously unruly seaside suburb of Rome. A local vote last Sunday in Ostia sent the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and a center-right coalition to the second-round runoff, but also showed a sharp increase in support for neo-fascist group CasaPound. The vote is being closely watched as it is the first since the local government was dissolved two years ago by police, who said city hall - responsible for assigning lucrative beach concessions - had fallen under the influence of organized crime. Ahead of the Nov. 19 run-off, reporters from state TV RAI went to interview Roberto Spada, the brother of an imprisoned mobster, who had expressed support for CasaPound on Facebook and had been photographed with the local candidate. RAI broadcast video showing reporter Daniele Piervincenzi repeatedly asking Spada, on the doorstep of his gym, whether his family had supported CasaPound and if he thought it could change the down-at-heel neighborhood. I don t give a shit, Spada eventually replies, before headbutting Piervincenzi in the face and chasing the bloodied journalist with a baton. CasaPound s prime ministerial candidate Simone Di Stefano told a news conference the attack was deplorable but said the party would not answer for Spada s behavior as he was not a member. The local candidate said the photo taken of him with Spada had happened to be snapped at a neighborhood event. RAI said the blow broke Piervincenzi s nose and doctors had told him he would need 30 days to recover. Rome Mayor Virginia Raggi tweeted the video, and wrote: Unacceptable Spada clan violence ... we will stop crime and extremism in Rome. Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni offered Piervincenzi his solidarity for the brutal aggression suffered in Ostia , and national police chief Franco Gabrieli said the incident showed the area still needs substantial work . A small player on the national stage, CasaPound won 9 percent of the vote in Ostia, where it hands out food to poor and homeless Italians, compared with 1.8 percent last time. CasaPound s Di Stefano challenged the judiciary to investigate whether there had been any arrangements by which votes were exchanged for money or favors in Ostia, adding his group had won between 5 and 8 percent of the vote in three cities since early last year. If we had been in some way favored in Ostia by a mafia clan, we would have had a boom there and in the rest of Italy we would have got 0.4. That s not how it is, he said. Spada was detained by police on Thursday and a judge is due to decide on Friday whether to formally arrest him.",1,fakenewsnet,,Battle for Rome's beachfront turns bloody with assault on journalist

The national security strategy, to be rolled out in a speech by Trump, should not be seen as an attempt to contain China but rather to offer a clear-eyed look at the challenges China poses, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The strategy, which was still being drafted, may also reverse Democratic President Barack Obama’s declaration in September 2016 that climate change is a threat to security, one official said. Trump, a Republican, is to lay out his foreign policy priorities, and will emphasize his commitment to “America First” policies such as building up the U.S. military, confronting Islamist militants and realigning trade relationships to make the United States more competitive, the officials said.",1,fakenewsnet,,Trump to say in security speech that China is competitor: officials

"A Chandler, Arizona family awoke early one morning to see that the Menorah sculpture on their lawn had been vandalized and turned into a swastika.

"When alleged president Donald Trump doesn t like unfavorable coverage, then he calls it fake news. The media is striking back, though, after his repeated attacks. Trump is plagued with scandals after being on the job for just a few weeks. To address his ousted national security adviser Michael Flynn s scandal, Trump said that the former aide was subjected to criminal leaks in the fake media. I think he s been treated very, very unfairly by the media as I call it, the fake media, in many cases, Trump said at a joint press conference Wednesday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. I think it s really a sad thing he was treated so badly. Trump needs to get his story right with his team. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said just yesterday that Trump demanded Flynn s resignation because of trust issues.Trump thinks the disgraced retired General is a swell guy:Trump called Flynn a wonderful man and doubled down on his condemnation of the leaks from the intelligence community that exposed Flynn misled senior officials in the White House about his conversations with Russia s ambassador. Those conversations took place the day that then-President Obama imposed sanctions on Russia for its interference in the election. From intelligence, papers are being leaked, things are being leaked, it s criminal action. It s a criminal act, and it s been going on for a long time before me, but now it s really going on, Trump said.Watch: People are trying to cover up for a terrible loss that the Democrats had under Hillary Clinton, he added.He said the same thing on Twitter this morning. He s blaming Hillary Clinton for his scandal-plagued administration.This Russian connection non-sense is merely an attempt to cover-up the many mistakes made in Hillary Clinton s losing campaign.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration’s plan to set federal borrowing on a sustainable path relies on stronger economic growth than what is seen by other big government agencies, which in turn have been lowering their expectations. The administration’s view, laid out on Tuesday in its annual budget proposal, is that gross domestic product will grow 2.3 percent each year over the long run. The median policymaker at the Federal Reserve, however, sees long-term growth at 2 percent, which is the same rate seen by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office. The differences are modest but show White House economists are being slower to downgrade their view of America’s growth potential. While the Fed and the CBO have been cutting their views on long-term growth in recent years, the White House has held steady in each budget submitted since early 2013. Over the same period, the CBO has cut its view from 2.2 percent and the views of core Fed policymakers have gone from a 2.3-2.5 percent range to a 1.8-2.2 percent range. It is impossible to make a full apples-to-apples comparison between the administration’s view with those of the Fed and CBO. The administration’s projections are based on the assumption its budget is fully enacted, which is unlikely to happen. Proposed immigration law changes would make the workforce younger and more productive while infrastructure investments would also boost efficiency, the administration said in the budget. Prominent academics including former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and Northwestern University economist Robert Gordon have warned that U.S. growth may have shifted persistently lower in recent decades. A stronger growth view allows the White House to project that the national debt will stay around 75 percent of GDP through 2026. The CBO by comparison sees debt on an upward path over the period, hitting 86 percent in 2026. White House economists acknowledge slower growth would put pressure on the budget, saying in Tuesday’s proposal that a 1 percentage point slowdown in GDP growth would add $3.1 trillion to the deficit in the decade through 2026. The budget also assumes a modest pace of health care inflation, easing strains on the budget created by an aging society, while arguing that proposed investments and immigration reform will help productivity growth. But the proposal notes that slower productivity growth and higher health care costs could result “in a debt explosion, with debt-to-GDP reaching over 500 percent by (around 2090).”",1,fakenewsnet,,White House debt path view tied to optimistic growth forecast

"Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt has received an unprecedented amount of death threats, requiring a 24-hour security detail, according to an editorial published in the Wall Street Journal.The paper revealed the EPA has received more than 70 credible threats against EPA staffers, with a disproportionate number menacing Administrator Scott Pruitt and his family, since President Donald Trump took office.Credible threats from liberal opponents have resulted in the EPA s inspector general s office recommending 24/7 security detail for Pruitt, which is costing taxpayers $2 million per year. Mr. Pruitt has received more than five times as many threats as his predecessor, Gina McCarthy, the editorial explained. These include explicit death threats. Some have referenced Mr. Pruitt s home address. Federal law enforcement has determined that some of those threatening Mr. Pruitt are likely capable of carrying out acts of violence. Democratic lawmakers have complained that the security detail is a waste of money, claiming there is no apparent security threat against the administrator to justify such a security detail or expenditures. EPA security has already caught suspects prowling around the Administrator s neighborhood, the Journal reported.Liberals have justified the death threats. Last week, a San Francisco columnist argued death threats against Pruitt were justified because he is a banally evil, milquetoast, science-denying government administrator.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said on Sunday that any woman who has felt violated or mistreated by a man has every right to speak up, even if she is accusing President Donald Trump. “Women who accuse anyone should be heard,” Haley said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “They should be heard, and they should be dealt with.” Washington has been roiled by sexual misconduct scandals, with accusations leading to the resignations last week of three members of Congress. The growing wave of women reporting abuse or misconduct has brought down powerful men, from movie producer Harvey Weinstein to popular television personality Matt Lauer. Haley, discussing that cultural shift, applauded the women who have come forward: “I’m proud of their strength. I’m proud of their courage.” Asked how people should assess the accusers of the president, Haley said, it was “the same thing.” More than 10 women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct before he was president. While filming a segment of the television program “Access Hollywood,” he talked about kissing and groping women. Trump has denied the misconduct allegations, although he apologized for his comments, which he called “locker room” talk. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said on Thursday that sexual harassment allegations against Trump were addressed by the American people when they voted him into office in November 2016. Asked whether Trump’s election settled the matter, Haley said: “That’s for the people to decide. I know that he was elected, but women should always feel comfortable coming forward, and we should all be willing to listen to them.” On Tuesday, voters in the heavily Republican state of Alabama will cast their ballots in a race involving Republican Roy Moore, a former state judge, and Democrat Doug Jones, a former U.S. attorney. Moore has been accused of sexual misconduct toward women when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s. One woman said he tried to initiate sexual contact with her when she was 14. Reuters has not independently verified the accusations, which Moore, a conservative Christian, has denied. Many Republicans, including Alabama’s senior U.S. senator, Richard Shelby, have distanced themselves from Moore. But Trump has endorsed him, saying he wants to see the Senate seat stay in Republicans’ hands.",1,fakenewsnet,,"Haley: Women accusers should be heard, even if Trump is target"
"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil s government will issue a new decree changing the country s definition of slavery following an earlier order that was widely criticized as a reversal in the fight against forced labor, a presidential aide said on Friday. In Brazil, forced labor has been defined as a form of modern-day slavery. This includes debt bondage, degrading work conditions, and long work hours that pose a risk to a worker s health or life, and violate their dignity. Human rights campaigners said a decree issued by the labor ministry on Monday changed the way slavery was defined, limiting it to a victim s freedom of movement but disregarding other abuses. The new decree, sought by Brazil s powerful farm lobby, would derail enforcement efforts that have freed 50,000 workers from slavery-like conditions since 1995, according to federal prosecutors and labor inspectors. Responding to the criticism, President Michel Temer said on Friday the decree would be modified but not revoked. In an interview with the Poder360 news website, Temer said the measure would be perfected with suggestions by prosecutors, among them the creation of a police department for slave labor crimes. A presidential aide later said the suggestions would be used to reissue a new decree. The president instructed the labor minister to study them and see which can be incorporated in a new decree, the spokesman said. Rights groups estimate hundreds of thousands of people work in slave-like conditions on farms, sugar cane plantations and cattle ranches across Brazil s remote and jungle areas, as well as in urban factories and construction sites. The government decree as issued would close 506 of 706 working conditions cases under investigation, which would no longer be considered slave labor, a spokesman for Brazil s federal prosecutors office said. Temer bowed to pressure from the farm lobby to modify the decree at a time when he is relying on the group s votes in Congress to block corruption charges next week. The farm lobby praised the decree for clarifying the definition of slave labor and eliminating excesses by inspectors. Temer told Poder360 the decree needed changing because it contained irrelevant details for defining slavery, such as the need for a soap bar holder or a ladder to a top bunk in workers sleeping quarters.",1,fakenewsnet,,Brazil government to rework controversial slavery decree

"BELFAST (Reuters) - The head of the Democratic Unionist Party said on Monday Northern Ireland would leave the EU on the same terms as the rest of the United Kingdom, rebuffing a suggestion from the bloc that the region remain subject to some of its rules. Brussels has said it will not move to the second phase of Brexit talks with Britain until London provides additional detail of how it will guarantee that there be no hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. Chief EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier on Monday asked the British government to detail what specific EU rules it would retain in Northern Ireland to ensure regulatory equivalence between the region and the Irish Republic and thus avoid the need for a hard border. But the head of the DUP, whose votes the government of British Prime Minister Theresa May is dependent on to pass legislation, repeated her rejection of the suggestion on Monday, saying she would not create barriers to business with the rest of the United Kingdom to allow smooth trade with Ireland. Northern Ireland will exit the EU on the same terms as the rest of the United Kingdom, Arlene Foster said in a statement ahead of a meeting with May on Tuesday morning. We will not countenance a border in the Irish Sea. I welcome the Prime Minister s commitment on this. The EU has said the UK needs to come forward with concrete proposals on the Irish border and on what past financial commitments it will honor by early December if EU leaders are to declare at their Dec. 14-15 summit that enough has been achieved to start talks on a transition period and a trade deal. Britain is scheduled to leave the bloc in March 2019. Foster said the EU s stance on Northern Ireland amounted to blackmail. Those in Dublin and Brussels, recklessly trying to use Northern Ireland for their own objectives, should cease, she said in the statement. The Prime Minister should warn Brussels that Northern Ireland must not be used as blackmail.",1,fakenewsnet,,DUP says Northern Ireland will leave EU on same terms as rest of UK

"I was wondering if I could get a cake that says: Gay marriage is wrong. The tolerant answers that follow this question show the astounding hypocrisy of the left.Say that Bestiality Is Wrong or Polygamy Is Wrong and it s not considered hate speech, but if you have the opinion that Gay Marriage Is Wrong the whole world jumps up and down screaming racism bigotry and hatred .This is becoming the politically-correct norm, but no matter what one argues, this is suppressing free speech.No one targeted pro-gay bakeries, but gay activists target Christian bakeries. Support Gay Marriage is one Christian bakery was sued for refusing to put that slogan on a cake for an event to support the gay agenda. Yet Christian bakeries that refuse to make pro-homosexual marriage cakes are getting sued left, right, and center. They get fined, they get death threats, and they lose their businesses. This experiment proves beyond doubt that the gay agenda is not just about their freedom to practice a sexual orientation, but the suppression of free speech.To make our case we provided 3 video clips, the third one is a video showing homosexual activists in Ireland used the state to force a Christian bakery to make a cake with the slogan Support Gay Marriage for a pro-gay marriage event, but he refused which added a tremendous loss to his business. Several Christian bakeries were sued in the United States with several who lost their businesses and we said enough is enough.So Shoebat.com decided to call some 13 prominent pro-gay bakers in a row. Each one denied us the right to have Gay Marriage Is Wrong on a cake and even used deviant insults and obscenities against us. One baker even said all sorts of profanities against Christians and ended the conversation by saying that she will make me a cookie with a large phallus on it.It was all recorded. It will stun the American people as to how militant and intolerant the homosexual bakers were. Even after we completed our experiment we got a ton of hate messages saying that we were hateful for simply giving them a taste of their own medicine. They argued that the slogan Gay Marriage Is Wrong is not the same thing as Support Gay Marriage as if an opposite view of a view is hateful. This would mean that the majority of Americans who oppose gay marriage are bigoted and hate filled . Support Polygamy or Polygamy is Wrong are views, yet the first which the Muslim supports and the second most Americans would never support, but both are opinions and are considered free speech.Watch what happens when a customer wants to buy a cake for his pro-traditional marriage event:****WARNING****STRONG LANGUAGE ALERT*** Language used by baker to customer on phone is extremely vulgar: homosexual activist in this third video said you can t choose who you serve, as though he is taking a purely objective position, but when we ask for the reverse of the same message, all of a sudden the saying of you can t choose who you serve, does not apply to us, the Christians.OUR POINTHere is our point. A Christian making a homosexual cake with Support Gay Marriage goes against his faith and a homosexual putting Gay Marriage Is Wrong goes against his faith as well. Now of course we honor their right to say no, this is not the issue, but what about honoring the Christian right to also say no?CONCLUSIONThe big lie of the homosexual agenda is this: They claim that they are only fighting for equality and tolerance.This is false.What then is their agenda?Via: Christian Patriot",0,fakenewsnet,,WATCH WHAT HAPPENS WHEN CHRISTIAN MAN ASKS 13 GAY BAKERIES TO MAKE PRO-TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE CAKE [Video]

"NUEVO LAREDO, Mexico (Reuters) - Glafiro Montemayor’s scrubland near the U.S. border may not look like much but within a few years he hopes to transform it by building a giant new bridge across the Rio Grande, setting his sights on billions of dollars in U.S.-Mexico trade. Hailing from a long line of Mexican customs brokers, Montemayor bristles at U.S. Republican candidate Donald Trump’s promise to build a wall between the two countries and his threat to rip up the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), a treaty that has been good to Nuevo Laredo. Montemayor believes Nuevo Laredo’s border bridges are near capacity and he wants to build another on his wiry, mesquite-filled land that could eventually develop into a bi-national free trade zone, luring investment and jobs. “He (Trump) wants to build walls, and the bilateral relationship requires that we build bridges,” Montemayor said in his air-conditioned office, surrounded by hunting trophies. Like Montemayor, many in trade-dependent Nuevo Laredo fear Trump’s proposed policies could threaten the city’s economic future and they hope Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton wins the Nov. 8 election. Nonetheless, some fear Clinton, who was first lady when her husband Bill signed NAFTA in 1993, may have absorbed some of the anti-trade views espoused by Trump and her Democratic primary campaign rival Bernie Sanders during a bruising campaign. In particular, they fret about her public backtracking over the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, which is seen as a key driver of future growth for the city. Trump calls NAFTA the worst trade deal ever signed by the United States, claiming Mexico got all the benefits and it led to U.S. firms shipping jobs south. He has vowed to renegotiate the treaty, or possibly even scrap it. Over $1.5 billion in trade crosses the U.S.-Mexico border each day and few places rely as heavily on that commerce as Nuevo Laredo, a feisty northeastern Mexican border city full of factory workers and truckers, but also drug traffickers. Every day, a 6-km (3.7-mile) line of trucks backs up into Mexico, waiting to haul everything from tomatoes to fridge freezers across the World Trade Bridge into Texas. Car parts, agricultural products and plastics go the other way. At least 40 percent of bilateral commerce flows across that bridge and nearly 20 percent of Mexico’s value-added tax, or about $5 billion, is collected from the 12,500 trucks that cross the frontier each day, the World Trade Bridge authority says. The bridge, it adds, is now the second most lucrative U.S. port after the Port of Long Beach in Los Angeles. On a visit to the bridge itself, it is easy to understand why Mexican drug cartels have fought vicious battles to control the Nuevo Laredo crossing, turning the city into a hotbed of teenage gunslingers and nervy soldiers. Of the 6,500-odd trucks that enter the United States each day, officials can only search 1,000 at most. Drugs move north into the United States and guns and cash easily flow south. Bootlegging has long been a way of life here. The former Zetas cartel kingpin Miguel Trevino, aka Z-40, was born in Nuevo Laredo, and Edgar Valdez, or La Barbie, a one-time associate of jailed capo Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, is a native of Laredo, just across the river in Texas. Those involved in legitimate cross-border trade clam up when talk turns to drug smuggling, a scourge that Trump has used to bash Mexico, and prefer to talk about lawful commerce. Since the September 11 attacks in 2001, when the United States tightened its borders, Nuevo Laredo’s business community learned the hard way that security was the primary concern for its northern neighbor. “Those days were terrible. The borders were almost closed,” said Carlos Martinez, a customs broker, radio host and academic. But as a result of U.S. security concerns, he said trade practices improved, with the development of efficient programs like the Free and Secure Trade (FAST) scheme which allows trusted importers to transit quickly across the border. Ever since, the trend along the border has been for greater integration and more streamlined borders, Martinez said. For example, as of 2015, the Cross Border Xpress bridge allows travelers to cross seamlessly between Tijuana airport and San Diego. That same year, the first new rail bridge between Mexico and the United States in over a century opened. So, regardless of campaign politics, some here believe Clinton is more committed to free trade than she has shown publicly in this campaign and that even Trump will need to protect bilateral trade if he wins. Sean Doherty, a 35-year U.S. Customs and Border Protection veteran, was involved in the development of the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT), a supply chain program with over 11,000 companies enrolled that helps expedite secure cross-border commerce. He said the program is one of many border schemes that both the U.S. government and thousands of businesses had invested heavily in to create and run. “I think (Trump) would have a lot of push-back or blowback if he tried to disband that type of a program,” Doherty said. “A lot of his rhetoric is just that, rhetoric. And if he does happen to win, I think a lot of things that he’s proposing - he’ll come back down to earth.” Miguel Conchas, president of the Laredo Chamber of Commerce, is also dubious Trump could fulfill all his campaign promises. Nonetheless, he said the Trump effect is already being felt across the river in Texas. The real estate mogul’s ascent has helped push the peso currency to record lows, hurting Laredo’s retail and banking businesses which rely on Mexican customers. Alfredo Espinoza, who runs the World Trade Bridge trust in Nuevo Laredo, is downcast about the election, and feels a more protectionist era is imminent. “We don’t think Trump is going to win,” he said, speaking in his office overlooking a seemingly endless line of trucks. “Nonetheless, Hillary ... won’t open the U.S. market, she will protect it. That scares us here in Mexico.”",1,fakenewsnet,,"Mexico's border trade capital craves Clinton win, with caveats"

"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Tuesday said an almost two-month pause in North Korean missile tests was no indication that it had halted its weapons development, insisting it was too early for any talks with the regime. I believe that it continues to develop its weapons, Abe told a news conference in Manila after a series of meetings with other Asian leaders at a gathering of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and East Asia Forum. There is no point for talks for the sake of talks, he said. Abe s insistence that tough sanctions, including restrictions on oil sales, are necessary to soften up the North Korean regime over the coming winter could put him at loggerheads with other countries such as South Korea that might agree to open talks if approached by the North. After firing missiles at a pace of about two or three a month since April, North Korean missile launches paused in September, after it fired a rocket that passed over Japan s northern Hokkaido island. Abe said he would work closely with other countries in the region including China and Russia to persuade North Korea to halt missile development and give up its nuclear weapon ambitions. Abe, in a meeting Chinese President Xi Jinping at an Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Vietnam on Saturday, hailed a fresh start to the relationship between Asia s two biggest economies and military powers, including cooperation on North Korea.

"WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (Reuters) - Minority voters in North Carolina will have a harder time casting a ballot this presidential election year if a judge allows a law requiring photo identification at the polls to take effect, challengers of the law said in federal court on Monday. But a lawyer representing the state said only a small number of people may not have the necessary forms of identification and exceptions will be allowed under an amended version of the measure. “It’s a policy question,” lawyer Thomas Farr said. “The evidence here does not rise anywhere close to showing a discriminatory intent.” The trial in Winston-Salem is one of several closely watched voting rights battles that will play out across the country as Democrats and Republicans fight for the White House in November. Democrats argue voter ID laws passed by Republican-led state legislatures target voters who typically support the Democratic party. Proponents of the measures say they are intended to prevent voter fraud. The case in North Carolina tests a key piece of broad voting restrictions passed soon after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2013 that states with a history of discrimination no longer needed federal approval for voting law changes affecting minorities. The U.S. Justice Department and National Association for the Advancement of Colored People argue North Carolina’s revised voting protocol disproportionately burdens African-Americans and Hispanics, who are more likely than whites to lack the acceptable forms of identification. The law “threatens to deter, confuse and disenfranchise voters,” said Michael Glick, a lawyer representing the NAACP. “It sets out to solve a problem that never existed.” Last summer, U.S. District Judge Thomas Schroeder heard arguments about the state’s decision to shorten its early voting period, end same-day registration, eliminate pre-registration for 16- and 17-year-olds and stop provisional ballots cast outside the correct precinct from being counted. He has not issued a decision. The voter ID requirement is getting a separate vetting after lawmakers amended it in 2015 ahead of the initial trial. Now voters who cite a “reasonable impediment” to being able to obtain acceptable identification will be allowed to cast a provisional ballot. South Carolina is the only other state with a reasonable impediment provision, Farr said. Challengers said the law remains discriminatory and could give election workers too much discretion. It is unknown if Schroeder will rule before the state’s presidential primaries in March.",1,fakenewsnet,,North Carolina's voter ID law goes on trial

"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - President Enrique Pena Nieto on Wednesday replaced his close ally and finance minister, Luis Videgaray, after the two were heavily criticized for Republican U.S presidential candidate Donald Trump’s controversial visit to Mexico last week. A somber-looking Pena Nieto told a news conference that Videgaray, who officials said was the architect of Trump’s visit, would make way for former Finance Minister Jose Antonio Meade. Pena Nieto was widely pilloried for hosting Trump at short notice last Wednesday. The New York businessman has repeatedly vowed to build a border wall to keep out illegal immigrants - which he said Mexico would pay for. Trump has further infuriated Mexicans by threatening to carry out mass deportations and rewrite trade treaties crucial to their economy, and by referring to some immigrants from the United States’ southern neighbor as rapists or drug runners With economic growth sluggish, the president’s popularity at record lows and tensions palpable between the finance minister and other Cabinet members, rumors of Videgaray’s impending departure had bubbled under the surface in Mexico for months. “The proverbial last straw was the Trump visit,” said Agustin Barrios Gomez, a politician from the opposition leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution, and a driving force behind a draft bill sent to Congress this week to empower the government to retaliate against Trump if he threatens Mexican interests. “(It) was seen as such a fiasco that he no longer had the credibility necessary to do his immediate job,” he added. Senior diplomats said Videgaray, 48, had been instrumental in arranging the American’s visit, in which the government had hoped to impress upon Trump the need to moderate his tone and reconsider his more divisive campaign proposals. But within hours of leaving Mexico, Trump was telling a cheering crowd of supporters in Arizona that Mexico would pay for the border wall “100 percent,” prompting fresh ridicule of Pena Nieto at home. Instead of teaching Trump a lesson, the visit “legitimized him as a potential head of state,” said Andres Rozental, a former deputy Mexican foreign minister. “It just shows how little thought went into it.” Trump commented on the resignation during a forum with U.S. veterans on NBC television when he was asked if the United States could take a chance with him as commander-in-chief. “Well, I think absolutely,” he said. “I think if you saw what happened in Mexico the other day...I let them know where the United States stands. I mean, we’ve been badly hurt by Mexico...And if you look at what happened, look at the aftermath today where the people that arranged the trip in Mexico have been forced out of government. That’s how well we did.” Videgaray ran Pena Nieto’s election campaign, and was long regarded as the most powerful Cabinet minister, with a huge influence on policy after orchestrating the country’s landmark energy, telecommunications, tax and education reforms. Both men were embroiled in conflict-of-interest scandals in late 2014, after Pena Nieto’s wife and Videgaray were found to have acquired property from a major government contractor. Pena Nieto ordered an inquiry, which cleared both of any wrongdoing. The respected new finance minister, Meade, is a friend of Videgaray and had started in the administration as foreign minister before moving to the social development ministry. Videgaray’s departure from the Cabinet means Interior Minister Miguel Angel Osorio Chong, on whose watch capo Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman escaped from prison before being recaptured, is now the most visible potential presidential candidate in 2018 for the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. Polls show the main hopefuls for 2018 face a tough battle, with Osorio Chong leading prospective PRI contenders. Meade, who was also once energy minister, is among those hopefuls. He must now steer next year’s budget through Congress, with the draft plan to be announced on Thursday. Senator Ernesto Cordero, a former finance minister from the center-right opposition, said he expected a smooth handover to Meade, whose experience in government he underlined. “He’s been a minister five times, and on those five occasions he’s done a good job,” Cordero said. The economy has consistently fallen short of government growth forecasts during Videgaray’s tenure, and contracted in the second quarter for the first time in three years. The new budget will be under close scrutiny after rating agency Standard & Poor’s last month said it could cut Mexico’s credit rating following a marked increase in debt. Videgaray, who has also been rumored as a potential 2017 gubernatorial candidate for the PRI in the State of Mexico, a populous region next to the capital, will not take another public post, a finance ministry spokeswoman said.",1,fakenewsnet,,Mexico president replaces finance minister after damaging Trump visit

"This church congregation should be ashamed.After all, it was a year ago that Watermark Community Church sent a letter to Jason Thomas formally rejecting him as a member of the church simply because he is gay. In our attempt to shepherd you, we have recognized a destructive pattern that prohibits us in caring for you and playing the role you desire for us to have in your life, the letter stated. Specifically, your desire to actively participate in a same-sex relationship with another man, and your unwillingness to heed biblical counsel from your church to turn from that relationship, has made it exceedingly difficult to shepherd you during this time. The church goes on to claim in the letter that they value the way God has uniquely formed you, but wants him to change by following the church s counsel and to meet a person named Brandon who has similar homosexual feelings. Notice how the church literally outed Brandon?Anyway, Jason clearly was not welcome back to the church unless he agreed to be someone he is not so he stayed far away. One year later, Jason is happy and is comfortable with who he is and with his sexuality. So he wrote a reply to Watermark Community Church informing them that their choice to reject him was the best thing that could have happened to him.Here s is the full letter via Pink News.Dear Watermark Community Church,Today I celebrate a very interesting anniversary with you. It was exactly one year ago when you told me that I was no longer worthy to serve, be in a community group, and be a member of your church.I spent years in your church battling against my homosexuality. I believed with all my heart that God would change me; I prayed for change almost daily. But when I wasn t able to change, you turned your back on me.You say our sin is not unique, but you treat us in a unique manner; this is unacceptable behaviour. We are actual people that have actual feelings.Here we are a year later and you are still doing to others what you did to me. You are tarnishing the name of God to Christians and non-Christians alike; you should be ashamed of yourselves! Do not forget, Jesus was angry with people just like you who said certain groups of people were not worthy to be followers of Him.Thank you for removing yourself from my life! I am who God made me to be. I cannot change my sexual orientation and nor would I want to. I now have internal peace and happiness unlike ever before.Jason ThomasIndeed, while this church is busy persecuting people for being gay, there are almost certainly many members of the church who commit adultery or other sins on a daily basis who are not being rejected by the church like Jason. Even the church elders are not without sin yet they are busy hypocritically casting stones at people who are gay.Watermark responded to Jason by telling the Dallas News that, An individual s formal relationship with us as a member is only changed when someone no longer desires to resist sin and refuses our help, care and encouragement. Even if someone s formal membership status is removed, they are always welcome to attend Watermark and be reminded of the grace and truth of our savior Jesus Christ. Yeah, that s complete bullshit and is exactly why more and more people are no longer attending church. Jesus said love thy neighbor as thyself, but apparently this church isn t a fan of Jesus teachings, which did not include ostracizing gay people.Featured Image: i.ytimg.com",0,fakenewsnet,," Texas Church Rejects Man For Being Gay, But He Gets The Last Laugh A Year Later"

"BEIJING (Reuters) - China has launched more rigorous investigations into the activities and finances of rights lawyers and law firms that take on politically sensitive issues, Human Rights Watch said on Tuesday, in its multi-year campaign to stifle dissent. China has arrested, jailed or detained thousands of rights lawyers and activists since President Xi Jinping launched a sweeping crackdown in the summer of 2015. Judicial officials and police are investigating the cases and finances at seven law firms that often work on rights abuses, lawyers at the firms told the New York-based Human Rights Watch. With unusually high-level officials performing scrutiny on site for days, the duration of investigations has exceeded that of previous regular checks on such firms, it added. While China s human rights lawyers are no strangers to official harassment, these sudden, invasive probes send an alarming message, Sophie Richardson, the group s Washington-based China director, said in a statement. China s justice ministry did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment from Reuters. China has defended the new measures against critics by saying it is a country with the rule of law, and that those found guilty are criminals who damaged social stability and endangered national security. There has been an open attack on rights lawyers under Xi, and the probes should be considered in the context of the attack, said Maya Wang, a China researcher for HRW based in Hong Kong. It is meant to tell lawyers that this is not over, that they had better be on their best behavior for the 19th Party Congress, Wang said, referring to a five-yearly leadership reshuffle of the ruling Communist Party set to begin on Oct. 18. Political checks and requirements for law firms have also been tightened under Xi, making it harder for lawyers to take sensitive cases, activists say, especially as law firms can be held jointly accountable for individual violations. Chinese law firms are required to explicitly support the party and to set up an internal party branch, while lawyers are banned from expressing opinions that endanger national security or reject China s political system. In the run-up to the party congress, Xi has also urged public security officials to ensure stability and maintain the party s authority and unified leadership.

"On Sunday, Donald Trump s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway appeared on NBC s Meet the Press. During her appearance, she was grilled about Trump s former birther stance.Trump recently denounced his birther views after weeks of being hounded by the press. Since then, the Trump campaign has tried to move past the matter. Given that Trump was one of the key propagators of the conspiracy theory, they are not going to be able to do that anytime soon.The show s host, Chuck Todd, asked Conway what made Trump come to the conclusion that President Obama was in fact born in the United States. It s a fairly straightforward question that Conway did not want to answer. You ll have to ask him that. That s a personal decision, Conway replied.Conway then alleged that it was Hillary Clinton s aides were the ones that started the birther conspiracy. This stems from the fact that several Clinton supporters spread an anonymous chainmail around that pushed the birther conspiracy. However, no one actually knows where the origins of that email, or the conspiracy itself came from. Who cares about the Clinton incident? Todd shot back. Donald Trump for five years perpetuated this. This has been arguably part of his political identity for the last five years forget the Clinton incident for a minute, why did he perpetuate it for five years? Conway then said that It makes a huge difference who started this. We were reminding people where this started. It was used as a smear against Sen. Obama by Clinton campaign associates and by the way, not a bunch of summer interns who just got it all wrong and were a little bit too ambitious. I understand why you re deflecting, Todd responds. You are deflecting. This was five years of his political identity. It s impossible to know who actually started the birther conspiracy. That s why Conway and other Republicans have begun using that talking point during interviews. While actually knowing who came up with conspiracy would be interesting for historical reasons, that information will probably never come to light. Trump and his campaign are desperate to sidestep the issue because they know that it is a major embarrassment.Propagating the conspiracy was also Trump s first major step into the political arena. The people who believe in it constitute Trump s base. Every time he speaks out against it, he is at risk of alienating the base.You can watch the interview below.Featured image from video screenshot",0,fakenewsnet,, WATCH: Trump Campaign Manager REFUSES To Answer This Simple Birther Question

"CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. farm groups criticized President Donald Trump’s decision to retreat from his predecessor’s opening toward Cuba, saying it could derail huge increases in farm exports that totaled $221 million last year. A trade delegation from Minnesota, one of the largest U.S. agriculture states, vowed to carry on with its planned visit to Cuba next week. “We’re going to continue to beat the drum and let them (the Trump administration) know that trade is good for agriculture,” said Kevin Paap, a farmer in the delegation. Trump signed a presidential directive on Friday rolling back parts of former President Barack Obama’s opening to the Communist-ruled country after a 2014 diplomatic breakthrough between the two former Cold War foes. Farm groups saw the move as a step backward in what had been an improving trade relationship between the two countries which are just 90 miles (145 kms) apart, even though agriculture is not directly targeted. U.S. law exempts food from a decades-old embargo on U.S. trade with Cuba, but cumbersome rules on how transactions were executed have made deals difficult and costly. Since Obama’s detente, substantial headway has been made, however, with shipments of U.S. corn and soybeans to Cuba soaring 420 percent in 2016 from a year earlier to 268,360 tonnes, U.S. Department of Agriculture data shows. Through the first four months of 2017, total shipments of U.S. grain and soy were 142,860 tonnes, up from 49,090 tonnes during the same period of 2016. While the quantities are dwarfed by total U.S. exports — nearly 56 million tonnes of corn alone last year — the added volumes were welcome as farmers face a fourth year of languishing grain prices and crimped incomes. “At a time when the farm economy is struggling, we ask our leaders in Washington not to close doors on market opportunities for American agriculture,” Wesley Spurlock, president of the National Corn Growers Association, said in a statement. The group sees an opportunity for $125 million more a year in trade to Cuba. Trump’s move could cut off near-term sales and stymie economic development that would drive longer-term demand growth, said Tom Sleight, president of the U.S. Grains Council, a grain trade development organization, in a statement. “Neither of those outcomes is favorable for the U.S. ag sector or the Cuban people,” he added. Paap said the United States should be doing more to encourage exports. “It’s frustrating because we’ve made some advances and built those relationships,” he said.",1,fakenewsnet,,"U.S. farmers slam Trump's Cuba clampdown, press forward with trade visit"

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday picked a fossil fuel industry defender as his top environmental official, another retired general as homeland security chief and Iowa’s governor as U.S. ambassador to China in choices at odds with some of his recent pronouncements. Trump, continuing to build his Cabinet as he prepares to take office on Jan. 20, said Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, 48, would be nominated to head the Environmental Protection Agency. Pruitt sued the EPA in a bid to undo a key regulation under outgoing President Barack Obama that would curb greenhouse gas emissions blamed for climate change, mainly from coal-fired power plants. Trump tapped retired Marine Corps General John Kelly, 66, for secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, whose responsibilities include immigration. Kelly, the third retired general named by Trump to a senior administration post, last year told Congress that a lack of security on the U.S.-Mexican border posed a threat to the United States. Trump’s transition team said Republican Iowa Governor Terry Branstad, 70, who has boasted of close ties to Beijing’s leaders, was picked as U.S. ambassador to China. In addition, transition officials said Linda McMahon, 68, former CEO of professional wrestling company WWE and wife of wrestling kingpin Vince McMahon, was Trump’s choice to head the Small Business Administration. Trump has taken part in WWE events in the past and has close ties to the McMahons. He is a member of the WWE Hall of Fame. All four posts require Senate confirmation. Pruitt’s selection came despite a softer tone Trump has struck on environmental regulation since his Nov. 8 election. He has stepped back from casting climate change as a hoax, signaled he might be willing to allow the United States to continue participating in the Paris climate change deal aimed at lowering world carbon emissions, and met with former Vice President Al Gore, a leading environmental voice. Pruitt’s selection brought a quick rebuke from Democrats. “The head of the EPA cannot be a stenographer for the lobbyists of polluters and Big Oil,” House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said of Pruitt. Trump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, brushed off the criticism, praising Pruitt’s record and telling reporters at Trump Tower: “We’re very accustomed to the naysayers and the critics.” Trump talked tough during the campaign about deporting all of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States and building a wall along the Mexican border. But since the election he has softened his comments on deportation and referred to some illegal immigrants as “terrific people.” Kelly would work in tandem with Republican Senator Jeff Sessions, Trump’s pick for attorney general, who is a leading advocate of cracking down on illegal immigration. The former four-star general would head a department in charge of securing borders against illegal immigration, protecting the president, responding to natural disasters and coordinating intelligence and counterterrorism. He formerly headed the Southern Command, responsible for U.S. military activities and relationships in Latin America and the Caribbean. He was a proponent of keeping open the U.S. military prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Trump previously picked retired Marine Corps General James Mattis as defense secretary and retired Army Lieutenant General Michael Flynn as national security adviser. Branstad has been an eager trading partner with China, helping Iowa sell agricultural goods to the Asian powerhouse. His choice came after Trump rattled the world’s second-largest economy with tough talk on trade and a telephone call with the leader of Taiwan. Trump has more key appointments to make in coming days, including the high-profile job of secretary of state. His team said former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, a fierce Trump critic during the campaign, is still under consideration for a diplomatic job. Aside from the personnel announcements, Trump basked in being named Time magazine’s “person of the year,” telling NBC’s “Today” show, “It’s a great honor, it means a lot.” In an interview with Time, Trump continued to take on corporate America, promising to bring down drug prices and causing shares of U.S. pharmaceutical and biotech companies to fall.",1,fakenewsnet,,"Trump fills homeland security, environment, China ambassador jobs"

"MANILA (Reuters) - Mutual praise, warm handshakes and even an impromptu love song at a lavish dinner suggest U.S. President Donald Trump and Philippine leader Rodrigo Duterte want a fresh start after the biggest breakdown in U.S.-Philippine ties in years. Their meeting on Monday during a summit of Asian leaders in Manila was arguably the most anticipated of the three-day event and went off well, with Duterte s aides talking up the rapport the two had, and Trump boasting of his great relationship with the similarly mercurial Philippines leader. It came a little over a year after Duterte announced his separation from the United States and sought new alliances with China and Russia. Angered by Barack Obama s criticism of his war on drugs, he told the then-U.S. president to go to hell , shocking American businesses and a Philippine military heavily reliant on the help of the Pentagon. Central to the rapprochement this week was Duterte holding his tongue, and Trump not expressing concern about Duterte s centerpiece policy - the crackdown on drugs that has killed thousands of Filipinos. Tensions and damage inflicted during the Obama administration has somehow been repaired, looking at the executive relationship, it has essentially been normalized, said Richard Javad Heydarian, an author and a political science professor at Manila s De La Salle University. The modus operandi is, Trump doesn t openly criticize Duterte s war on drugs and Duterte tones down his direct attacks on the U.S. Even with Trump in the White House, Duterte had repeatedly railed at the hypocrisy of his country s former colonial ruler. He has accused Washington of treating the Philippines like a dog and said he would not visit the United States, because it was lousy . But there was none of Duterte s trademark hostility this week and some indications that both countries had taken a calibrated approach to ensure the two leaders hit it off. Contrary to traditional seating protocol for a summit of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), the two were seated next to each other at Sunday s gala dinner. Duterte sang a hit Filipino love song at that event, and joked it was on the orders of the U.S. commander-in-chief . Although Duterte s fallout with Obama was acrimonious, the fissures between the two long-term allies did not run deep, with joint programs across various sectors largely intact. That included dozens of annual joint military exercises over the past year. This year, the Philippines military relied on U.S. technical support in its biggest-ever urban battle, ending a five-month occupation of a southern city by rebels loyal to Islamic State. There were no signs of an exodus of American business under Duterte either, with $353 million of investments from the United States recorded in the first eight months of this year, compared to $90 million in the same period in 2016, according to the Philippines central bank. There were conflicting accounts of what was discussed between Trump and Duterte on Monday, however. A White House spokeswoman said human rights was talked about, in the context of the drugs war. Duterte s spokesman, Harry Roque, said that was not the case, although Duterte had explained his anti-drugs campaign to Trump, who nodded and seemed to be in agreement . The relationship appears to be very warm and very friendly, getting very candid, Roque said. They have similar feelings toward former U.S. President Barack Obama. Duterte had said last week he would tell Trump to lay off if he talked about human rights. But according to a senior White House official, Duterte raised the issue himself. He had an explanation and he pre-emptively brought it up, the official said, estimating Duterte did 90 percent of the talking. The two leaders agreed to further strengthen the decades-old defense alliance between them, one that Duterte had previously threatened to abort. Heydarian, the professor, however said that even with improved ties, Trump would be powerless to stop moves by Duterte to diversify foreign relations beyond the United States to include China and Russia, and tap them for anything from loans and infrastructure to rifles and jeeps. I don t think that the Trump-Duterte convivial hobnob will ever be enough to change Duterte s strategic orientation, he said. We have stopped the hemorrhaging of the alliance, but it will never go back to being special and sacred as it was before Duterte came to power.",1,fakenewsnet,,"U.S., Philippines ties back on track as Trump, Duterte make up and bond"

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) CEO Lloyd Blankfein said Thursday on Bloomberg TV that he would not be “one bit disappointed” if President Donald Trump nominated Jerome Powell as the new Federal Reserve chair. “His background is a terrific background - again a lot of government service, service in the Fed, service in the private sector,” Blankfein said. “I think he is a very great, credible candidate. There were other credible candidates as well but I am not one bit disappointed if it turns out to be J. Powell.” Trump was expected on Thursday afternoon to nominate Powell for the post, putting his own stamp on the leadership of the U.S. central bank while signaling continuity on monetary policy. Asked about Powell’s lack of a PhD, Blankfein said, “I sometimes feel that people with PhDs - and believe me, I am not anti-intellectual, I have a law degree, my kids went to graduate school, I’m not against people who have PhDs — but sometimes I wish people who only have PhDs had a little more life and professional and business experience.” Blankfein also said a good U.S. tax plan will have “stimulative elements” and could get U.S. GDP growth to a higher level than 3 percent. “The free-est kind of stimulus you could provide for the economy is confidence and peeling away redundant or bad regulation, to be frank,” Blankfein said. Asked about Bitcoin, which soared past $7,000 to a new record high on Thursday, Blankfein said: “I have a level of discomfort with it as I have a level of discomfort with anything that’s new. But I learned over the years that there’s a lot of things that work out pretty well that I don’t love. “Right now, I tell you, I don’t have an investment in it. But I’m not willing to pooh-pooh it and that’s why, I say, I am open to it,” Blankfein added.",1,fakenewsnet,,Goldman's Blankfein: If Trump taps Powell as Fed chair wouldn't be 'one bit disappointed'

"BELLEVILLE, Ill. (Reuters) - The suspect who opened fire on Republican lawmakers as they played baseball on Wednesday raged against Republican U.S. President Donald Trump on social media and idolized Bernie Sanders, whom he saw as the only politician who understood the working class. Authorities identified the gunman as James Hodgkinson, a 66-year-old home inspector from the St. Louis suburb of Belleville, Illinois. He died from injuries sustained in a shoot-out with Capitol Hill police who were at the scene in Alexandria, Virginia, outside Washington. Hodgkinson is believed by investigators to have been a person “of strong views,” a senior U.S. official said, without elaborating. The Belleville News-Democrat newspaper posted a photograph of Hodgkinson protesting outside a post office there in 2012, wearing sunglasses and a goatee and holding a homemade placard that read “TAX the Rich.” Hodgkinson was a member of many anti-Republican groups on Facebook including “The Road to Hell Is Paved With Republicans,” “Terminate The Republican Party,” and “Donald Trump is not my President,” his profile showed before it was taken down. Trump won the U.S. presidential election in November. Republicans also control both chambers of Congress. “Trump is a Traitor. Trump Has Destroyed Our Democracy. It’s Time to Destroy Trump & Co.” Hodgkinson wrote in a March 22 post. His profile picture was a U.S. flag with the slogan: “Democratic Socialism explained in 3 words: ‘We the People.’” Hodgkinson went to Washington several weeks ago to protest against Trump’s election, his brother told the New York Times. The former mayor of Alexandria, Bill Euille, said he talked with the suspect at the local YMCA most mornings for more than a month, and even tried to help find Hodgkinson a job after seeing he was living out of a gym bag, the Washington Post said. Stephen Brennwald, an Alexandria attorney, also saw Hodgkinson at the YMCA wearing long pants rather than gym attire, and said he often seemed to be staring into space. “It’s just very freaky to think that this guy who was just sitting in there for weeks, not really doing anything, actually turned out to shoot at people,” Brennwald told Reuters. Hodgkinson’s Facebook profile featured a cover photo of Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont who ran unsuccessfully to be the Democratic Party’s presidential candidate last year. Sanders, an independent who ran as a progressive populist but was defeated by Hillary Clinton, said the suspect had “apparently volunteered” on his campaign. In a statement, Sanders condemned the shooting as a despicable act.” One woman who asked not to be named told Reuters that Hodgkinson had contacted her via Facebook as part of a political discussion, but that he subsequently commented on her page that Clinton was a “liar” and a “baby killer.” “I actually blocked him at one point,” the woman said. A bartender at the Pork Barrel BBQ in Alexandria said Hodgkinson started coming in for beers about a month ago. “He was a regular-looking guy that kind of gave you a sense of the creeps, but you can’t really put your finger on it,” said Christina Shrimshaw, 27, who served him a handful of times but never remembered him discussing politics. “He would talk about very mundane things, like golf. He was big into watching the Golf Channel.” A neighbor in Belleville, William Schaumleffel, recalled how in March he heard gunshots and saw Hodgkinson shooting with a long gun toward woods across a corn field from his yard. “I yelled at him: ‘Hey, stop shooting over there. There are houses over there,’” Schaumleffel said. Hodgkinson did not stop, he added, so he filed a report with the sheriff’s office. Hodgkinson’s criminal history included a 2006 arrest on battery charges that were later dismissed, as well as multiple traffic violations, according to state records that identified him as a 5-foot, 6-inch (1.67-metre) man weighing 190 pounds (86 kg), with brown eyes. Most of the infractions were ultimately dropped. Hodgkinson had been licensed as a home inspector and real estate appraiser, but did not renew his home inspector license after it expired last year, state records showed. His license to appraise real estate expired in 1997. According to Facebook, Hodgkinson went to Belleville Township High School West and studied flight training at Southwestern Illinois College. Beginning in mid-2015, Hodgkinson began expressing support for Sanders’ 2016 campaign, and federal records showed he donated $18 to the effort. “Bernie is the Only Candidate in Decades that Really Cares about the Working Class,” Hodgkinson posted on June 13, 2016. The Belleville News-Democrat published letters he wrote the paper criticizing Republicans, tax policies and income inequality. One from August 2012 read: “I have never said ‘life sucks,’ only the policies of the Republicans.”",1,fakenewsnet,,Suspect in baseball field shooting ranted against Trump on social media

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. consumer financial watchdog on Thursday attempted to repel a Trump-administration attack on former President Barack Obama’s sweeping student loan reforms and defended itself against Republican attempts to weaken its powers. In a lengthy letter to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) said it had complied with its remit, despite her department’s charges to the contrary. The Education Department announced last week it would no longer work with the bureau on resolving student loan complaints, saying it had complicated the lending process “with potentially inaccurate and inconsistent directives.” It said the consumer bureau, created after the 2007-09 financial crisis to protect individuals from predatory lending, was not honoring an agreement to promptly refer complaints to the department, but using the department’s data “to expand its jurisdiction into areas that Congress never envisioned.” The Obama-appointed head of the watchdog, Democrat Richard Cordray, said the bureau shares complaint information in “near real-time” through an on-line portal with the department. It has “not exceeded its authority,” and only fulfilled its mission under federal law to monitor and respond to individuals’ complaints about debts as well as enforce federal consumer law, Cordray wrote. Congress created the bureau in part to mediate between consumers and credit card companies, banks, mortgage providers and other lenders. The dispute goes beyond a mere territory fight. Republicans revile the CFPB, saying it reaches too far in its rules and enforcement and should be more accountable to lawmakers. Democrats have said it helps ensure fair treatment for middle-class people unable to fight fraud on their own. Republicans also disapprove of Obama’s attempt to make college more affordable by moving almost all of the $1.4 trillion student-loan industry into the federal government. Currently, only servicing is handled outside the Education Department. During last year’s elections, Trump and fellow Republicans promised to “get government out of the business of lending” and DeVos is now working to return much of the process to the private sector. She also wants to redo other Obama-era regulations, such as protections for sexual-assault victims on college campuses. DeVos critics consider the department’s split from the CFPB as a way to protect for-profit schools, debt collectors and servicers from government intervention. Earlier this year the bureau, which has received nearly 20,000 complaints about student loan servicers since February 2016, sued the country’s largest servicer Navient Corp for systematically failing borrowers. Navient disputes the allegations and is contesting them in court.",1,fakenewsnet,,U.S. consumer agency defends student loan reforms from Republican attacks

"MANILA (Reuters) - Leaders of Asian nations meeting in Manila on Monday skirted around the mass exodus of Rohingya Muslims triggered by Myanmar s military crackdown, disappointing human rights groups who were hoping for a tough stand on the humanitarian crisis. There was no pressure either from U.S. President Donald Trump over the Philippines bloody war on drugs during a meeting on the sidelines of the summit with President Rodrigo Duterte. Trump told reporters that he had a great relationship with Philippines leader, who, a year ago, had branded then-President Barack Obama a son of a bitch for questioning his ruthless campaign. They really hit it off, Duterte s Communications Secretary Martin Andanar told reporters after the meeting with Trump. A draft of the statement to be issued after a meeting of Southeast Asian leaders made no mention of the flight of Rohingya from military operations in Myanmar s Rakhine state that the United Nations has described as ethnic cleansing. One paragraph mentioned fleetingly the importance of humanitarian relief for affected communities in Rakhine state. The statement was drawn up by the Philippines, current chair of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which includes Myanmar. It did not use the term Rohingya for the persecuted Muslim minority, which Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi has asked foreign leaders to avoid. The government in mostly-Buddhist Myanmar regards the Rohingya as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and does not recognize the term. Over 600,000 Rohingya have fled to refugee camps in Bangladesh since military clearance operations were launched in response to attacks by Rohingya militants on Aug. 25. The plight of the Rohingya has brought outrage from around the world and there have been calls for democracy champion Suu Kyi to be stripped of the Nobel peace prize she won in 1991 because she has not condemned the military s actions. Some ASEAN countries, particularly Muslim-majority Malaysia, have voiced strong concern over the issue recently. However, in keeping with ASEAN s principle of non-interference in each others internal affairs, it appeared to have been put aside at the summit. With Myanmar having ethnically cleansed 600,000 Rohingya Muslims in just two months, it s time for ASEAN to transcend its do-nothing approach to atrocities among its members, said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, in a Twitter message. The ASEAN leaders did agree that they should not take a lull in the dispute over the South China Sea for granted. While the situation is calmer now, we cannot take the current progress for granted, they said in a statement drafted ahead of a meeting with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang. It is in our collective interest to avoid miscalculations that could lead to escalation of tensions. China claims almost all of the sea, one of the world s busiest waterways. Taiwan and four ASEAN nations - Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Brunei - have competing claims. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte suggested ahead of the summit that, despite their differences, the leaders should not discuss the South China Sea. We have to be friends. The other hotheads would like us to confront China and the rest of the world on so many issues, he said on Sunday. The South China Sea is better left untouched. At the meeting s formal opening on Monday, he pointed to other triggers for a threat of violence in the region, including terrorism, violent extremism, and piracy on the seas. The menace of illegal drug trade continues to endanger the very fabric of our society, he said. More than 3,900 people have been killed in the war on drugs that Duterte declared when he took office last year. His government says the police act in self-defense, but critics say executions are taking place with no accountability. The United States and the Philippines, a former U.S. colony, have been strategic allies since World War Two. But their relations have been strained by anti-U.S. outbursts from Duterte and his enthusiasm for better ties with Russia and China. However, the animosity of the past appears to have been all-but forgotten, and Duterte - who has been called the Trump of the East for his brash style and coarse language - told the U.S. president: We are your ally. We are an important ally. Trump was criticized earlier this year after he praised Duterte during a phone call for the great job he was doing to counter illegal narcotics. The two leaders seem to have warmed to each other after meeting for the first time on Saturday at a meeting of Pacific Rim leaders in Vietnam. On Sunday, Duterte crooned hit Filipino love song Ikaw (You) at a gala dinner in Manila, saying it was on the orders of Trump. One of the song s verses begins: You are the light in my world, a half of this heart of mine . On the last leg of a marathon Asia tour that has taken him to Japan, South Korea, China and Vietnam, Trump told reporters that he had made significant progress on trade issues. We ve made some very big steps with respect to trade, far bigger than anything you know, he said, describing his trip as fruitful and adding: It was red carpet like nobody, I think, has probably ever seen.",1,fakenewsnet,,Human rights skirted at Asia summit as Trump rounds off tour

"THE HAGUE (Reuters) - Dutch judges jailed a onetime aide to Ethiopia s former communist ruler Mengistu Haile Mariam for life on Friday for war crimes carried out during Ethiopia s Red Terror purges of the 1970s, including the execution of 75 prisoners. Eshetu Alemu, 63, was found guilty at his trial in the Hague of ordering the 1978 killing of camp detainees - many of them under 18 years of age - who were taken from their cells and strangled with ropes in a church. In the hearings held under Dutch universal jurisdiction, Alemu, a former Mengistu regional representative, was convicted of all charges brought by prosecutors, including arbitrary detention, inhumane treatment, torture and mass murder. The fact that the majority of victims were children younger than 18 makes the crimes all the more cruel, said presiding judge Mariette Renckens. Alemu came to the Netherlands as an asylum seeker in 1990 and had been in custody since 2015. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges but was not present when the verdict was read out. Negus Gebeyehu, a prisoner in a camp under Alemu s control, gave an emotional speech in the Hague court following the verdict as other victims cheered. Justice has been done for Ethiopia, he said. I was imprisoned as a young man and I survived. This is also the day for us to forgive. An Ethiopian court had sentenced Alemu to death in absentia in 2007 for his role in the Red Terror , which Mengistu s communist military junta conducted after Ethiopian emperor, Haile Selassie, was ousted in 1974. Mengistu was found guilty in absentia of genocide in the same trial in 2007, where he and top members of his military government were accused of killing thousands during his 17-year rule. Today s verdict shows perpetrators that the Netherlands will not be a safe haven, Jirko Patist of the national prosecutor s office said. The Netherlands is one of the European countries that has established an international crimes prosecution unit to prosecute alleged war criminals residing in the Netherlands even if their crimes were committed abroad.",1,fakenewsnet,,Ethiopian ex-official gets Dutch life sentence for war crimes

"DAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - A senior Tanzanian politician quit the ruling party on Monday complaining of human rights abuses and a weakening of democracy in the east African nation, in a move political analysts said could trigger a wave of defections to opposition parties. Since taking office in late 2015, President John Magufuli has introduced sweeping reforms, including as an anti-corruption drive that has won him some praise from Western donors. But his administration is also increasingly being accused by his opponents of undermining democracy by curbing dissent and stifling free speech, including banning newspapers. On Monday, Lazaro Nyalandu, who once served as a cabinet minister and has been a member of parliament for the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party for 17 years, said he was deeply concerned by human rights abuses and the direction of the economy. It is evident that CCM has lost its way judging from the current political climate, leadership and economic trajectory in Tanzania, Nyalandu said in a statement. I have decided to resign from my position as a member of the CCM national executive committee and all other leadership positions in the party effective from today. Nyalandu said he had also submitted his resignation as a member of parliament. The veteran politician was among more than a dozen candidates who sought the ruling party s presidential nomination in 2015 but was defeated by Magufuli. Bashiru Ally, a Dar es Salaam-based political analyst, said Magufuli s reforms could prompt further defections from the ruling party but said the opposition was poorly placed to benefit from such a trend. Opposition parties are overly dependent on personalities who defect from CCM, he told Reuters. (But) they can only make temporary gains from such defections. They are not institutionalised and lack mass grassroots mobilization strategies. CCM, which has been in power since Tanzania gained independence from Britain in 1961, has seen its support among young urban voters decline in previous elections, but opposition parties are too fragmented to oust it from power, analysts said.",1,fakenewsnet,,"Senior Tanzania ruling party MP quits, cites democracy concerns"

"(Reuters) - New Zealand not only has its youngest female prime minister with the rise to power of center-left Labour leader Jacinda Ardern, but a renegade new first bloke who is a national celebrity in his own right. Clarke Gayford, who hosts his own fishing television show, has already broken the mold of his predecessors, stepping in to defend his partner against scaremongering old dinos including one political rival who made a disparaging reference to Ardern and lipstick on a pig . On Twitter, Gayford has thrown fishing buddy jokes to Winston Peters, the leader of the small nationalist party that decided Ardern s political fate and teased a nation that waited a month for an election result: heading out of reception for a while..... things always seem to happen when I do this. Gayford s social media followers are likely to surge following the decision this week of Peters New Zealand First Party to throw its support behind 37-year-old Ardern and her Labour Party to form government. Political analysts say the pair are a unique double act in a small country where the partners of the previous two female leaders, Helen Clark and Jenny Shipley, maintained a low profile. This political power couple will be interesting to watch, said Grant Duncan, associate professor at Massey University in Auckland. They re both clearly very media savvy, both independent and have public profiles that were built up before they became a couple. The couple met four years ago when Gayford, 39, went to complain to a member of parliament about the then National Party government s proposed changes to security legislation. He bumped into Ardern, a rising star of the Labour Party, they had coffee and were living together not long after. Gayford s television show, Fish of the Day, sees him traveling around the Pacific, fishing and finding recipes for his catches. The series has been sold into 20 countries and won a gold award at the Houston International Film Festival last year. Gayford, who grew up on a farm without a television in summer, has a long history in broadcasting across television and radio. He s an occasional guest on weekly talkback radio show The Panel. On election night last month, Gayford admitted to being a little on edge as he brought out barbecued sausages and fish bites - made, naturally, from a 42kg sea bass he caught off the east coast - to reporters staking out the couple s home in Auckland. And he told Radio New Zealand recently that he s still coming to terms with elements of his new life, including a security detail unfamiliar to somebody who spends much of his time out on the open water: It s been a hell of a ride.",1,fakenewsnet,,New Zealand's 'first bloke' hooks into new role

To back up his claims, Sheffield cites the 2014 Pew Research study finding that 23 percent of Americans say they re unaffiliated with any religious tradition, up from 20 percent just three years earlier.The trend away from religion, and Christianity in particular, Sheffield argues, is the real cause of Republicans woes and their failure to win the last two elections. The likely reason why Republicans have declined in popularity among the non-religious is GOP s long habit of identifying itself as a Christian party, he states. The later attempt to add in a Judeo- prefix has done little to stop the bleeding. While the statistics showing a rise in the religiously unaffiliated are undoubtedly sobering to people of faith, Sheffield fails to mention that the very same Pew study showed that over 70 percent of Americans continue to identify as Christian.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In backing Roy Moore in Alabama’s U.S. Senate race even though the candidate faced allegations of sexual misconduct with teenage girls, President Donald Trump made a risky bet - and lost big. The victory by Democrat Doug Jones over the Republican Moore in the Alabama special election on Tuesday was a catastrophe for Trump, portending a Democratic wave next year that could cost Republicans control of one or both houses of Congress. The stakes in Alabama were that high. Democrats already were confident they had a strong chance to retake the U.S. House of Representatives in next year’s congressional elections. Jones’ narrow victory increases their once-long odds of retaking control of the Senate as well. If Democrats were to recapture both chambers, they would serve as a check on Trump’s agenda and might even initiate impeachment proceedings against him. “That Republicans lost in one of the most Republican states in the nation is a wake-up call no matter how flawed their candidate was,” said Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic strategist and former aide to Democrat Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. Democrats never expected to have a chance in Alabama, where they had not won a U.S. Senate race in 25 years. But the combination of Trump’s unpopularity, the sexual misconduct allegations that erupted against Moore in November, and Trump’s enthusiastic support of him anyway gave them the opportunity, experts said. “Trump was the one who got Jones within firing range, and Moore allowed Jones to win,” said Kyle Kondik, a political analyst at the University of Virginia. Even as Democrats lost several special congressional elections this year, they consistently showed higher levels of turnout and engagement, which is attributable to Trump, Kondik said. The Alabama race showed there were limits both to Trump’s endorsement power and his judgment. Even as senior Republicans urged Trump to abandon Moore, the president decided instead in the campaign’s final days to throw the full weight of his office behind him. In the end, that was not enough, and early turnout reports suggested that many Republicans stayed home. Moreover, despite the sexual misconduct allegations against Moore, the race near the end increasingly seemed to become about the president. Moore’s camp this week said the contest was specifically a referendum on Trump and his presidency. “It is Donald Trump on trial in Alabama,” Dean Young, a strategist for Moore, told ABC News. Trump congratulated Jones on Twitter “on a hard fought victory” and added: “Republicans will have another shot at this seat in a very short period of time.” The loss was also a body blow to Steve Bannon, Trump’s former top strategist, who backed Moore in the primary against the Republican incumbent, Luther Strange, because he viewed Moore as a more reliable ally. Bannon also frequently characterized the race as less about Alabama and more about furthering Trump’s economic nationalist agenda. Bannon is looking to wage an insurgency against the Republican establishment in the 2018 congressional elections, particularly Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who condemned Moore after several women accused him of unwanted sexual contact when they were in their teens and he was in his 30s. Moore, 70, has denied the allegations, and Reuters has not independently verified them. ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT Beyond Moore, Bannon is supporting anti-establishment candidates such as Kelli Ward in Arizona, Danny Tarkanian in Nevada and Kevin Nicholson in Wisconsin, all of whom oppose McConnell staying on as Senate leader. Bannon also may ultimately support challenges against sitting Republicans in Mississippi and Wyoming. But Moore’s loss seems certain to dampen that effort, and Republicans who fear losing control of Congress may be even less likely to back outsider candidates who may turn off mainstream voters. It is now an open question whether Trump will inject himself into more Republican primaries, given his setback in Alabama. “When you nominate candidates who are unqualified and an embarrassment to the party, you run the risk of ruining your entire brand,” said Josh Holmes, a Republican consultant and close ally of McConnell. Bannon’s supporters say rank-and-file Republican voters are more likely to blame McConnell, not Bannon, for the loss in Alabama, arguing that McConnell and his well-resourced Senate Leadership Fund did nothing to help Moore. McConnell “actively opposed the Republican candidate in Alabama and threatened our Senate majority by helping to put a liberal Democrat in that seat,” said Andy Surabian, a former Bannon protégé who now advises a pro-Trump advocacy group, Great America Alliance. Even with the Alabama win, Democrats face a significant challenge next year if they are to take control of the Senate. They must defend 10 incumbents in states that were won by Trump and they must gain two seats currently held by Republicans. Their best opportunities to secure those seats lie in Arizona and Nevada, and perhaps Tennessee. Democrats need 24 seats to retake the House, but that is viewed as a more realistic goal because of the number of congressional districts where they are competitive, particularly in suburban areas. Brian Walsh, president of another pro-Trump group, America First Policies, said Trump could not be blamed for Moore’s loss, arguing that the president’s late endorsement almost won the race for Moore, a deeply flawed candidate. “He was trying to push a boulder up a hill,” Walsh said.",1,fakenewsnet,,Trump loses his big bet on Alabama U.S. Senate race

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump has launched a charm offensive of the type not seen before in his brief and chaotic tenure, forcefully rallying behind legislation to repeal the Obamacare healthcare law while trying to placate the bill’s opponents. In doing so, the often blustery Trump faces a test of credibility for the voters that catapulted him into office: How does a celebrity outsider, the CEO president, cut deals in Washington? Does the New York businessman live up to the image of dealmaker in chief? Interviews with more than a dozen White House and congressional aides, members of Congress and conservative activists offer a glimpse into his attempts at conducting the most formidable, high-stakes negotiation of his presidency. They show a more circumspect Trump than many see publicly. While they acknowledge he can make his points with a blunt and combustible style, he appears to be doing more listening than talking, they said, trying to appease both supporters and critics by signaling flexibility over legislation that faces criticism on multiple fronts. Democrats and some influential Republicans say it would rip health insurance away from millions of Americans and increase costs for many others, including voters who helped elect Trump - a problem that could haunt his fellow Republicans in 2018 congressional elections. Conservatives say it does not go far enough in gutting the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare reform passed by Democrats in 2010. Republicans have long sought to dismantle the law, which they see as government overreach. Trump has called Obamacare a “disaster” and made its repeal and replacement a key campaign pledge. The political stakes are immense for an eight-week-old presidency marked by instability, infighting, battles with the media, questions over temperament and a stubborn investigation into ties between his campaign and Russian intelligence. “A lot of times you have politicians who gather in a room to pontificate. That’s not why he has gathered people in the room,” a senior White House official said of Trump’s negotiation style this week. “He’s gathered people in to hear their opinions. I think that’s lost a little bit because he does speak so forcefully. He definitely does let them say their piece, and he listens.” The president has reached out to influential conservatives such as U.S. Senator Ted Cruz and groups such as the Heritage Foundation and Americans for Prosperity, which have expressed skepticism about the bill. “He was gregarious, reasonable. He listened. It was a not a lecture,” said Tim Phillips, president of AFP, a group backed by billionaires Charles and David Koch and part of a small group of conservative leaders who met with Trump in the Oval Office on Wednesday night. “He said: ‘This is a negotiation. Let’s figure out ways to make this proposal better,’” Phillips said of Trump. Trump has indicated he will only go so far to make conservatives happy, insisting the core elements of the bill must remain intact if it has any chance to pass the House of Representatives and then the Senate, both controlled by Republicans. One sticking point involves the use of tax credits to help consumers purchase health insurance, which Trump favors. “He’s made it clear this is the vehicle to finally undo the damage of Obamacare and repeal and replace it,” said another senior White House official. “And if it can be improved in this process, he has encouraged that.” Trump is operating with a razor-thin margin for success. A defection by 20 or so Republicans in the House could sink the bill’s prospects. There is already discontent among some in the Senate, where Republicans hold an even slimmer edge. Democrats and groups such as AARP, which advocates for older Americans, and the American Medical Association have come out strongly against the bill. Conservatives in the House and advocacy groups opposed to the bill would like to slow the process and rework its fundamentals. They argue the legislation retains basic facets of Obamacare, including federal assistance to purchase health insurance and penalties if coverage lapses. House Speaker Paul Ryan is hoping to pass the legislation within two weeks so the House can move on to other priorities. That leaves little time for wholesale alterations. Representative Kevin Brady, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said he expected the bill would largely remain in its current form. “I know lots of people have good ideas. That’s terrific. And those will fit in future bills.” The White House has tried to persuade conservatives that the House bill is just the first step in a three-step process, and will soon be joined by a companion bill that would embrace some of their policy priorities. Regulations put in place by Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price will also address their concerns, aides said. The challenge for Trump is whether he can convince enough wary conservatives to back the first step of the plan without being able to guarantee the other phases will come to pass. It could leave them on the record voting for a bill they do not feel adequately dismantles Obamacare. Some conservatives may also not see the point of sticking their necks out backing a bill that may die in the Senate. “This is a futile effort,” said Rachel Bovard, a policy analyst for the Heritage Foundation, which opposes the bill. The White House is aggressively making the case that the House bill is the best chance to do away with Obamacare. Moving too far rightward to placate conservatives could stir up opposition from moderate Republicans and lead to a bill that stokes a powerful backlash among millions of Americans who would lose health insurance - including many Republicans. Many Democrats are already planning to run campaigns on the issue. The White House was busy this week trying to reassure moderate Republicans as well. Vice President Mike Pence is holding meetings in Congress, including with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican aide said. Trump’s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, a former House member, has invited conservative lawmakers to dinner at the White House next Tuesday. Trump plans to leverage the power of his office in another way, making trips to Kentucky and Tennessee in coming days to sell the House bill to the American public. Earlier this week, Trump welcomed about 30 Republican House members, many of whom said they had never been in the White House before - a contrast in style from Obama, who was often criticized for not attempting to engage more fully with Congress. In the East Room, Trump told them to come back every week. Grover Norquist, a longtime conservative tax advocate, praised Trump’s strategy, saying: “He is making people feel loved and appreciated and part of the team.”",1,fakenewsnet,,Trump tests dealmaker image to sell healthcare bill

"WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand will partially ease fuel rationing on Thursday night, a spokesman for the country s oil industry said, a sign that the five-day long fuel shortage that has caused air travel disruptions is subsiding. More than 120 flights have been cancelled this week in New Zealand s largest city, Auckland, disrupting thousands of travellers each day, after the single privately owned pipeline that carries jet fuel from a refinery to the city s airport was damaged. National carrier Air New Zealand said it expected flights to run as usual on Friday, with no cancellations for the first time since Sunday. Airline fuel allocations will rise to 50 percent, from 30 percent, at midnight on Thursday, said Andrew McNaught, manager for Mobil New Zealand Ltd and a spokesman for the customers of the country s only oil refinery operator Refining NZ. Travel restrictions for government officials have been lifted, said Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment Spokeswoman Carolyn Tremain in a statement. New Zealand s government and oil industry have taken a series of measures to try to contain the crisis, from fuel rationing to calling on the military to help truck in supplies of fuel, and have set up an industry-government group to handle the fallout. A New Zealand navy vessel will ferry diesel fuel around the country as the government rushes to alleviate the shortage in the run-up to Saturday s national election. The ship will transport up to 4.8 million litres of diesel - equivalent to 150 tankers - to enable the oil industry to focus on providing jet fuel to Auckland airport, Energy and Resources Minister Judith Collins said on Thursday. The government will continue to do everything it can to support industry efforts to address the disruption, Collins said in statement. The measures are simply a stopgap until the pipe is repaired, which will take place by Sept. 26, McNaught said. The ordeal has become a headache for the ruling National Party which is battling it out with the newly invigorated Labour Party to form the next government. The latest poll showed the National Party held a near nine-point lead over Labour, but polls have been volatile and at times have shown Labour with a comfortable winning margin. Labour Party leader Jacinda Ardern has criticized the government of Prime Minister Bill English for not having taken measures to avoid the kind of infrastructure failure that led to the disruptive fuel shortage. Overnight, Australia s Qantas Airways operated two flights from Australia, nicknamed fuel mules , carrying fuel to top up Jetstar and Qantas aircraft in Auckland, the airline said. One was a scheduled A330 passenger service that carried an extra 10,000 kilograms of fuel, while the other was a special 747 flight with 65,000 kilograms of fuel aboard, it said.",1,fakenewsnet,,New Zealand jet fuel rations increased as government calls in navy to beat shortage

"Judicial Watch has been the one organization that s been reporting on the crazy expensive trips the Obamas have taken since day one. Barack Obama has been savaged by a top spending campaigner for taking the First Family on an eighth consecutive Christmas vacation to Hawaii, at huge expense to the American taxpayer.The President was accused of treating Air Force One, which costs $206,000/hour to run, like an Uber ride ahead of his next jaunt to his home state. Fly-time alone will set taxpayers back somewhere in the region of $3.5 million as Obama, the First Lady, Sasha and Malia and their two dogs jet off for around two weeks.They have traditionally rented a luxury villa in the upscale Kailua area on Oahu, the main island, and head out for hikes, rounds of golf and restaurant meals with their friends. Tom Fitton, the head of the Judicial Watch pressure group, said Obama s holiday habit proves that he is out of touch and has to stop. He told AL.com: The Obamas travel is out of control. They are treating the Air Force One like an Uber ride. And President Obama seems oblivious to the burden he is placing on Americans with his continuous vacations, getaways, and political junkets at taxpayer expense. During the trips, the Obamas are accompanied by a substantial Secret Service detail, who costs thousands of dollars a day to accommodate in the idyllic vacation spot. Local police also work overtime and an ambulance trails the Presidential party at all times in case of disaster all of which will push the total further into the millions. Although some expenses including the rent are paid for privately, the emergency personnel and daily expenses of Obama s security detail are all publicly-funded. Exact figures for the trip outside of Air Force One are hard to obtain. According to a Watchdog.com report on the 2014 trip, there is also an Air Force cargo plane to bring Obama s helicopter and limo, which costs more than $150,000 to get to Hawaii and back. A second plane brings a Marine Corps contingent at similar cost. The Honolulu Police Department also spends in the region of $275,000 a year in overtime for its officers, while the ambulance from the local Emergency Management Services costs $15,890 to keep on call.Secret Service agents of whom there are said to be dozens each year are reportedly housed at a cost of around $200 per person per night, while material for other security measures would also be met from White House funds. It is not yet clear precisely where the Obamas will stay, though they have traditionally favored somewhere near Kailua. During their year-end trips to the Hawaiian islands the Obamas typically lounge around their rental home, venturing out only on occasion for shaved ice and dinner with their friends. Since 2013, the Obama family have gone on scenic Christmas hikes, tried out snorkeling in Hanauma Bay and dined at the gourmet Alan Wong s Restaurant. President Obama generally spends his time on the golf course or working out at a local Marine Corps base.He and the First Lady usually make a special trip to the base to to wish the troops stationed there a Merry Christmas and to thank them for their service.The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed there are temporary flight restrictions in the area from December 19 to January 4. An islander also told Honolulu TV station KHON2 he had seen Secret Service in the area and had been given a flyer about security in Kailua Bay. The Hawaii trips are not the only examples of extravagance which have been seized on by critics. In March it emerged that the White House dropped at least $1million flying the President and the First Lady to Los Angeles and back on two separate planes inside a single day so they could be on TV. Barack Obama sat down with Jimmy Kimmel to appear on his NBC show, while Michelle grabbed the change to be interviewed by Ellen DeGeneres. Despite the two shows being filmed just miles apart, the White House insisted the journeys were not in sync so required separate planes. As well as the Christmas vacation, the Obamas typically take a summer retreat to Martha s Vineyard off the Massachusetts coast, allowing the President to tot up some more hours on the golf course.Read more: UK Daily Mail",0,fakenewsnet,,Obama’s Christmas In Hawaii To Cost Taxpayers $3.5 Million For Flight Time Alone

"Right-wing provocateur, Neo-Nazi, all around douchebag and Breitbart News editor Milo Yiannopoulos is finally getting his comeuppance for being a terrible human being. It seems that even the internet hellhole of misogynists, anti-Semites, racists, white supremacists, and other assorted bigots that is Breitbart has had enough of Milo since he came under fire for videos in which he openly defended pederasty. These revelations got him banned from speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), and now it seems that they may even cost him his job.The Hill is reporting that Milo s fellow employees at Breitbart are disgusted by his remarks, and a fair number of them are threatening to leave the company if Milo isn t given his walking papers. An unnamed senior editor leaked to the Washingtonian that Milo has been a problem for some time now, and that this is the straw that breaks the camel s back for at least half a dozen Breitbart employees: The fact of the matter is that there s been so many things that have been objectionable about Milo over the last couple of years, quite frankly. This is something far more sinister. If the company isn t willing to act, there are at least half a dozen people who are willing to walk out over it. Talking abut young boys and somehow seeking to ameliorate concerns over young boys relationships with older men I m pretty sure everyone in the company would vomit upon hearing these words. What right-thinking person doesn t feel sick to their stomach when hearing something like that? Granted, considering the filth that is printed at Breitbart and the types of people who frequent the place, this reaction to Milo s defense of the indefensible here is hardly something that redeems them.

"According to GOP Congressman Sean Duffy, we need to stop talking about terrorist acts committed by white people in the United States and hop on board the Trump Train. During an interview Tuesday morning with CBB s Alisyn Camerota, Duffy completely lost it when asked why the Trump administration seems determined to ignore any and all terrorist acts committed by white people as they focus on banning entry from seven countries that have not produced a deadly terrorist attack within our borders since 9/11. You don t have a group like ISIS or Al Qaeda that s inspiring people around the world to kill innocents, Duffy said when confronted with white terrorist attacks like the recent mosque massacre in Canada. That was a one-off. Pretending that the attack in Canada is the only recent example of a white extremist slaughtering innocents, Duffy continued harping about ISIS. How about the Charleston church shooting, Congressman? Camerota asked. He was a white extremist. That doesn t matter? At this point, things got crazy.

"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - A South African High Court ruled on Friday that it could not compel President Jacob Zuma to set up a commission of inquiry into alleged influence-peddling in his government. The opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) had asked the court to force Zuma to establish a commission based on a report last year by an anti-graft watchdog into allegations that businessman brothers Ajay, Atul and Rajesh Gupta had influenced the appointment of ministers. Zuma and the Gupta brothers have denied the accusations. The president has challenged the report in court, arguing that the Public Protector had no right to ask him to form such a commission, as this was the president s prerogative. To compel the President at this stage will not only be tantamount to denying the hearing or his day in court, but it will also be understood to mean the Public Protector s powers are unassailable irrespective of the content of the decision, that cannot be correct, Pretoria High Court Judge Motsamai Makume said. It will be in the best interests of justice to grant the President a stay of the implementation of the remedial action pending a decision of the review application. New allegations of inappropriate collusion between state-owned companies and the Gupta brothers have put more pressure on Zuma and ministers close to him. But the ruling was a boost for the scandal-plagued Zuma at a difficult time. Allegations of widespread corruption and the raiding of taxpayer funds by outside interests known locally as state capture have dented investor confidence in an economy which fell into a recession earlier in 2017. On Wednesday, thousands of South Africans marched in anti-corruption protests in a rallying cry against Zuma and his powerful allies three months before a new African National Congress leader is chosen. Zuma also survived a no-confidence vote in parliament in August but he lost the support of a number of ANC MPs, showing deep divisions within the party that has ruled South Africa since the end of apartheid in 1994. The DA said it had noted the ruling with interest , saying it approached the court to avoid delays in probing influence-peddling allegations. On a number of occasions, including before the National Assembly, President Zuma has stated that he will establish a Commission of Inquiry. To date, he has not done so, the party s federal council chairman James Selfe said in a statement. This matter has not been dismissed but has in fact been held back pending the outcome of the President s review application, which will be heard at the end of October, where we will also be in court to continue this fight for accountability. Some analysts said the legal battles would prolong probes into influence-peddling allegations. The court had its legal duties to perform, and this is going to allow Zuma not to perform his political duties, NKC African Economics analyst Gary van Staden said.
